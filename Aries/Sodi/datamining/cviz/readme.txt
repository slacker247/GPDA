Instructions for executing CViz on Windows 95/NT.

1. You must have the java runtime environment installed to run CViz.  This is available at the following URL:

http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/jre/index.html

2. After installing the jre you may execute CViz in one of two ways:

   1. Open a Command Prompt window, change to the directory where CViz was extracted, and type: "alpha filename", where filename is the name of a data file you want to give as input.

   2. Click on the "run.bat" file in the directory where CViz was extracted.


The first method will provide a simplified user interface to CViz.  The second method will give a fully functional version.


The files iris.csv and housing.csv are available in the install directory as a sample data input file.  Open these files by giving one of them as argument or by using the "File:Open Data File" command within CViz.  

The format of the input data is comma delimited with a header indicating the name of each column. 

If you have difficulty accessing the user manual from within CViz, edit the run.bat file 
so that the manual pointer is the full pathname of cviz.html instead of the relative 
path name.
