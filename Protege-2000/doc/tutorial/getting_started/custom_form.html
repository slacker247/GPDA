 Customizing a Form<br>
<img border="0" src="../../users_guide/classes/images/header_line.gif" width="536" height="5"></h1>

<p>Forms determine how your instance information is presented and entered. By
changing a form, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="#browser">change the browser key</a>, used to list your instances</li>
  <li><a href="#reposition">reposition fields</a></li>
  <li><a href="#hide">hide a field</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="browser"></a>Changing the Browser Key</h2>
<p>The <i>browser key</i> is the slot
that is used to identify the
    different instances when they are displayed in a list. If you do not select a slot to use as a browser key, Protégé-2000
uses a default key, <b> &lt;inherit&gt;</b>, such
as newspaper_0017. It is usually helpful to set a browser key for all classes
that will contain instances. In fact, you may choose to set the browser key
before you even start entering instances.</p>
<p>To set the browser key for the <b>Editor</b> slot:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the Forms Tab.</li>
  <li>Click on <b>Editor</b> in the Forms Pane to the left.. The default form
    appears in the Form Edit Pane to the right.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/forms_tab.gif" width="717" height="362"></li>
  <li>Select <b>name</b> from the <b>Form Browser Key</b> menu.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/forms_browser_key.gif" width="717" height="362"></li>
  <li>If you wish, view the Instances Tab to see that the name of the instances
    you entered now appears in the Direct Instances Pane. From now on, you will
    be able to view instances of <b>Editor</b> by their name field.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/forms_instances.gif" width="717" height="362"></li>
</ol>
<p>Now return to the Forms Tab to continue customizing the Editor form.</p>
<h2><a name="hide"></a>Hiding a Field</h2>
<p>To hide the <b>Byname</b> field:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the <b>Byname</b> field to select it. The <b>Selected Widget Type</b>
    menu becomes active, which allows you to customize the widget.&nbsp;<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/custom4.gif" width="717" height="362"></li>
  <li>Select <b>&lt;none&gt;</b> from the <b>Selected Widget Type</b> menu.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/custom5.gif" width="717" height="362"></li>
  <li>The field is removed from the form.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="reposition"></a>Repositioning Fields</h2>
<p>Now, you may no longer like the layout of the form. To reposition a field by
dragging:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select the <b>Name</b> field by clicking on it. It is outlined in blue to
    show it is selected.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/custom6.gif" width="717" height="362"></li>
  <li>Drag the field to the top of the Form Edit Pane.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/custom7.gif" width="717" height="362"><br>
    You can also resize a selected form by dragging the edges, just like any
    window.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you have a lot of fields, and you have deleted or resized several of
them, it can be time-consuming to move all the fields by hand. Protégé-2000
provides a short-cut to rearrange all the visible fields on a form into a
standard order, accomodating their current size. You can then use this as a
basis to further customize the form.</p>
<p>To have Protégé-2000 arrange the fields for you:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click the Default Layout button <img border="0" src="../../users_guide/forms/images/Relayout.gif" width="15" height="15">,
    the center button in the Forms Pane.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/custom8.gif" width="717" height="362"></li>
  <li>The form adjusts to close the gap caused by deleting one field and moving
    another.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/custom9.gif" width="717" height="362"></li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations. You have now created a simple project with Protégé-2000.
You can now explore the program on your own, using it to represent your own
ontology. For more information about the capabilities of Protégé-2000, see the
