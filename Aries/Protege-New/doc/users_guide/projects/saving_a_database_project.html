Saving a Database Project

<p>You can save a Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000 project as a single table in a JDBC database. Before you do this, you 
will need to do the following:</p>
	<ul>
  		<li>Make sure you have a database program installed on your system.</li>
  		<li>Make sure you have a JDBC driver that is compatible with your database and the version of the 
		Java VM that you are using.  If you are using Microsoft Access, you don't need to acquire a JDBC
		driver since it's already bundled into the JDK.  You can also ignore the third bulleted item in 
		this list.</li>
  		<li>Rename the driver to be &quot;driver.jar&quot; (or &quot;driver1.jar&quot; or 
        &quot;driver2.jar&quot; if you have several).&nbsp; Add this driver to the 
        Protege-2000 installation directory (NOT the plugins directory).</li>
	</ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> When a project is saved in a JDBC database, back-end changes to the database (for example, 
changes to slots, classes, and instances) are committed as soon as they are made. However, changes to 
the User Interface (which is stored in the .pprj file) are not committed until you press the Save button.</p>

<!-- <p>Once you have set up your JDBC database, you can save your Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000 project as a database 
files in one of two ways:
	<ul>
  		<li>When the project is first created, by selecting <b>JDBC Database</b> in the Select Format dialog box.</li>
  		<li>By selecting <b>Save in Format...</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu and then selecting <b>JDBC Database</b> 
		in the Select Format dialog box.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
 -->
 
<!-- <p>After you have chosen your format, choose the name and location for the project as follows:</p> -->

To save a project using the JDBC database project format:
<ol>
	<!-- <li>When you have selected <b>JDBC Database</b>, the Single Table JDBC Database dialog box is 
	displayed:
	<br><br><img border="0" src="images/SaveDatabase.gif" width="468" height="392"><br><br></li>
 	-->	
	
	<li><a href="creating_a_project.html">Create a new project</a> using the JDBC database project 
	format.</li><br><br>
	
 	<li>Choose the menu item Project -> Save or click the Save button on the toolbar to bring up the 
	&quot;JDBC Database&quot; dialog:
	<br><br><img border="0" src="images/SaveDatabase.gif" width="468" height="392"><br><br></li>

	<li>To select or change the name or location of the <b>pprj</b> file, enter the information you 
	want in the <b>Project</b> line of the dialog box. Be sure to give the file a <b>pprj</b> extension. 
	To browse for a new location, click the 
    <img border="0" src="images/Add.gif" width="19" height="19"> 
	button. If you do not specify a location for the project, by default, the project is saved in the 
	directory where Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000 is installed.</li><br><br>
	
	<li>Enter the class name of your JDBC driver in the <b>JDBC Driver</b> line of the dialog box. The 
	class name can be found in the documentation provided with your particular driver. For Microsoft 
	Access, use: sun.jdbc.odbc.JdbcOdbcDriver.</li><br><br>
 		
	<li>Enter the URL for your database in the <b>JDBC URL</b> line. For Microsoft Access, navigate 
	to the &quot;ODBC Data Source Administrator&quot; dialog via the Control Panel and add a User DSN for your 
	Access database. If you're unfamiliar with how to find this dialog or how to add a User DSN, please refer 
	to Microsoft Windows Help. Your URL will look like: jdbc:odbc:&lt;User DSN name&gt;</li><br><br>

	<li>Type a name for the table in the <b>Table</b> line of the dialog box.  Please note that this is a 
	required field.</li><br><br>

	<li>If your database requires a username and/or password, enter these in the appropriate lines of 
	the dialog box.</li><br><br>

	<li>Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can store multiple projects in the same database by giving their tables different names.</p>
