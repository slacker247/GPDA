<h4>The Challenge:</h4>
On 08 January, 2002 a default, unpatched installation of Solaris8 Sparc was
remotely compromised with the dtspcd exploit.  What makes this attack
interesting is that this is the first time the attack was identified and
captured in the wild, resulting a CERT advisory.<br>
Using the Snort binary capture of the attack, answer the following questions.
The honeypot that is attacked is 172.16.1.102.

<h4>What is a NOP slide, and how is this one different from the NOP slide in
the rpc.statd exploit in Scan10?</h4>

<p>In most buffer overflow exploits, the attacker does not know the exact
location of the shellcode. Even if the exact address of the shellcode can be
determined by examining the binary of the vulnerable program, different
versions of it might have different target locations. Recompiling or running
the program in a different environment can also change the address of the
shellcode. Since the difference in the location is often small, a NOP-slide
technique can be utilized to make the exploit more reliable.</p>

<p>A NOP-slide is a sequence of NOP (no operation) instructions strategically
placed before the real shellcode. Depending on the size of the buffer the
exploit is overwriting, there might be enough space for thousands of NOP
instructions before the shellcode. When a return address is overwritten (or the
execution of the vulnerable program is hijacked by other means), the jump
location does not need to point to the first instruction of the shellcode. It
can point to any of the NOP instructions in the buffer. The execution will
"slide" down the NOPs and reach the shellcode. The advantage of this technique
is that the attacker can guess the jump location with a low degree of accuracy
and still successfully exploit the program.</p>

<p>In x86 exploits the most commonly used NOP-slide uses opcode 0x90 (NOP).
Long sequences of NOP instructions are easily detected by network intrusion
detection systems like Snort. More sophisticated attackers would use a sequence
of normal (non-NOP) instructions that don't interfere with the execution of the
shellcode (like xor eax, eax).</p>

<p>The instruction used for the NOP-slide in the Solaris/Sparc dtspcd exploit
is xor %l1, %l1, %g0 (0x801c401 in the packet dump). This instruction has no
effect on the program flow and can be executed many times before the execution
reaches the real shell code.</p>

<p>The following hex dump is a packet sent to the dtspcd service (tcp/6112) on
the honeypot:</p>

<p>As you can see, the buffer is filled with more than 250 xor %l1, %l1, %g0
instructions. The attacker can point the return address anywhere within that
range and successfully exploit the service.</p>

<p>The only difference between this NOP-slide and the NOP-slide used in the
rpc.statd exploit from scan10 is the target architecture. The rpc.statd exploit
targets x86 and uses the 0x90 NOP instruction. The dtspcd exploit targets Sparc
and uses the xor %l1, %l1, %g0 instruction. Because of the different
instruction sets, the Sparc instruction is 4 bytes long and the x86 one is only
1 byte.</p>

<h4>The attack was on 08 Jan, 2002.  Would Snort have generated an alert then for the attack?</h4>

<p>A properly configured Snort system would have generated a SHELLCODE sparc
NOOP alert.  This rule has been in the snort rules (shellcode.rules and before
that in overflow-lib) since 2000:</p>

<pre>alert ip $EXTERNAL_NET any -&gt; $HOME_NET any (msg:"SHELLCODE sparc NOOP";
content:"|801c 4011 801c 4011 801c 4011 801c 4011|"; reference:arachnids,353;
classtype:attempted-user;)
</pre>

<p>While we are on the topic of IDS alerts, allow me to make a few
observations. As many people have pointed out before, setting up an IDS is not
sufficient for protecting a system from hackers. If this were the case,
intrusion detection systems would be installed and running by default on all
installations of RedHat or Debian. Unfortunately getting secure and staying
secure requires a whole lot of work. A Snort alert is useless if you don't
receive it (you should have all high priority alerts sent to you by SMS) or
don't react immediately. If you wait till next morning it might be too late to
save the corporate data. Very few organizations have good emergency response
teams and procedures, or even the resources for it. Even when the system
administrator is interested in security, his efforts are often limited by the
company-wide attitude of "we don't care and even if we did, we wouldn't have
the money for it". The most common security practice in 2002 is based on the
incompetence of the average script kiddie - certainly not a viable long turn
option. But enough ranting, let's get back to business.</p>

<h4>In the exploit code, the command "/bin/sh sh -i" is given, what is its
purpose, and why is 'sh' shown twice?</h4>

<p>The exploit executes writes the line "ingreslock stream tcp nowait root
/bin/sh sh -i" to /tmp/a and then executes /usr/sbin/inetd with /tmp/a as a
configuration file. The format for the configuration file is described in the
inetd.conf man page. The last two fields are &lt;server_path&gt; and
&lt;args&gt;.</p>

<p>When inetd receives a connection on port 1524 (ingreslock), it executes
/bin/sh with parameters 'sh' and '-i'. The first parameter (argv[0] for the C
programmers reading this) is the name of the program as it appears in ps, the
second one is the 'run interactive' command line option. Without this option
the hacker will have to separate her shell commands with a semicolon. With -i
the shell works just like a normal shell.</p>

<p>The attacker executed a variety of commands on the hacked Solaris box.
Which commands were automated by the exploit, which commands were manual by the
attacker himself?</p>

<p>The first session on port 1524 (ingreslock) is definitely run by a script.
The time between consecutive commands is rarely more than a few seconds. Each
command is send as in packet, instead of sending it character by character as
telnet would do. One of the packets even includes two commands separated by a
newline - something very unusual for any command line tool. During the ftp
login the username, password and all ftp commands are sent before the server
gets a chance to respond with the username prompt.</p>

There are two places where there are 20-30 seconds between two commands. It is
possible that the attacker had a file with the commands to run and was
pasting them into a netcat session, a few lines at a time.

<p>The session follows:</p>

<pre>uname -a;ls -l /core /var/dt/tmp/DTSPCD.log;PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/
bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/gnu/bin;export PATH;echo "BD PID(s): "`ps

</pre>

<p>After the commands in the ingreslock session are executed, the atacker
connects to the honeypot with telnet, negotiates the telnet options and
immediately disconnects. The purpose of this is to verify that the telnet
server is running, without leaving too many traces in the system logs.</p>

<p>It is very likely that this attack was executed by an automated script and
the attacker was going to return to the machine later.</p>

<h4>What is sun1, and how does it work?</h4>

<p>sun1 is a part of a Solaris rootkit. The original /bin/login is copied to
/usr/lib/libfl.k and replaces with sun1. The primary job of login is to
authenticate users and handle logins, and as such it is a primary target of
many rootkits.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the snort capture was corrupted and reconstructing sun1 from
the ftp session was impossible with both ethereal and tcpflow. The file was
reported as truncated by objdump, gdb and IDA. But even without disassembling
the file, it is easy to guess what it does.</p>

<p>When the hacker telnets to the compromised machine, sun1 is invoked. If the
hacker enters a magic username or password, sun1 executes /bin/sh and gives the
attacker root access to the machine. If a user logs in with a normal username
and password, sun1 forwards them to the real login program, which was stored in
/usr/lib/libfl.k.</p>

<p>The following strings found in sun1 confirm this analyzis:</p>

<pre>/usr/lib/libfl.k
pirc
/bin/sh
/bin/ksh
login
</pre>

<h4>What did you learn from this exercise?</h4>

<p>Black hats often get their hands on cool exploits before the rest of us.
Ph34r!</p>

<h4>How long did this challenge take you?</h4>

<p>3 hours.</p>

<h4>Bonus Question:<br>
One of the commands executed during the attack is<br></h4>

<code>echo "BD PID(s): "`ps -fed|grep ' -s /tmp/x'|grep -v grep|awk '{print $2}'`</code>

<h4>What is the purpose of this command and what does 'BD' stand for?</h4>

<p>Let's take it apart:</p>

<p><code>echo "BD PID(s): "</code> prints "BD PID(s): "</p>

<p><code>ps -fed</code> prints a full listing of all processes on the system, omiting
session leaders</p>

<p>The process listing is piped through grep, which prints only the lines
that contain '-s /tmp/x'. This lists the copy(ies) of inetd that our
exploit has started.</p>

<p><code>grep -v grep</code> filters out the grep command from the list</p>

<p>The awk script takes the second field out of the process listing
(the process id) and prints it.</p>

<p>The end result is something like this:<br>
<code>BD PID(s): 4177 4182 31310</code></p>

<p>I am not sure what BD stands for, but my guess is 'background' or 'bind
daemon'. This command shows the attacker the process id of the inetd executing
the session.</p>
