<p>You can change the following global properties of a form:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="changing_form_characteristics.html#browser">Change the browser key</a>, that is the slot
that is used to identify the
    different instances when they are displayed in a list.</li>
  <li><a href="changing_form_characteristics.html#layout">Change the layout</a> by selecting a single widget that takes up most of
the horizontal and/or vertical space as the form expands.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="left"><a name="browser"></a>Setting the Browser Key</h2>

<p>The browser key identifies the
    different instances when they are displayed in a list.&nbsp;For example, the
form for <b>Prototype_Newspaper</b> has the browser key set to <b>weekday</b>.
This means that, in the <a href="../instances/instances_pane.html">Direct
Instances Pane</a>, the different instances are listed by the value in the <b>weekday</b>
field.</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp; <img border="0" src="images/browse_instance.gif" width="236" height="197"></p>

<p align="left">If you do not select a slot to use as a browser key, Protégé-2000
uses a default key, <b> &lt;instance name&gt;</b>, such
as newspaper_0017. It is usually helpful to set a browser
key.</p>

<p align="left">To set a browser key for a class:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Select the name of the class whose form you wish to edit in
    the <a href="forms_pane.html">Forms pane</a> at the left of the <a href="forms_tab.html">Forms
    Tab</a>.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Click the <a href="browser_key.html"> Browser Key menu</a>. A list of slots is displayed.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Select the slot you wish to use as a browser key.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2 align="left"><a name="layout"></a>Changing the Layout</h2>
<p align="left">You can choose a widget that will expand as the form expands
whenever the Protégé-2000 window is resized. This can be useful, for example, when you
have a complex table widget that you wish to have take up most of the form. To
do this:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Double-click anywhere on the background of the form, that
    is, on an area that does not contain a widget. The <a href="form_configuration.html">Form
    Configuration dialog box</a> is displayed.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Click on the Layout tab.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">To select a widget that will take up most the vertical room
    when the form expands, select the widget name from the Fill Vertical Space
    With: menu. Selecting <b>&lt;all&gt;</b>  means each widget will expand
    equally.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">To select a widget that will take up most the horizontal
    room when the form expands, select the widget name from the Fill Horizontal
    Space With: menu. You can select the same widget or a different one.
    Selecting <b>&lt;all&gt;</b>  means each widget will expand equally.</li>
</ol>
<p>To reset the form so that no widget expands more than the others, make sure
that <b>&lt;all&gt;</b>  is selected in both menus.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> For additional tasks that change a forms appearance, such as
resizing, moving, changing, or hiding a widget, see the <a href="index.html">Forms Table of Contents</a>.</p>
