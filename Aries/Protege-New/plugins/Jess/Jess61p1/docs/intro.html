<h2>1.
        Introduction</h2>


<a name="abstract">
<h3>1.1. Abstract</h3>
</a>
This report describes Jess, an expert system shell and scripting
language written entirely in Sun Microsystem's Java language. Jess
supports the development of rule-based expert systems which can be
tightly coupled to code written in the powerful, portable Java
language. The syntax of the Jess language is discussed, and a
comprehensive list of supported functions is presented. Guides to
calling Java functions from Jess, to extending Jess by writing Java
code, and to embedding Jess in Java applications are also included.



<a name="compatibility">
<h3>1.2. Compatibility</h3>
</a>
Jess 6.1 is compatible with all versions of Java starting with Java
1.2. In particular, this includes JDK 1.4 (or "Java 2" as it is now
known.) Versions numbered 4.x are compatible with JDK 1.0, and the 5.x
versions work with JDK 1.1.
<blockquote>
        When compiling Jess with JDK 1.4, you will see warnings
        concerning the use of the new keyword <tt>assert</tt> as a
        method name. This is normal -- note that these are warnings,
        not errors. The <tt>assert</tt> method is deprecated in Jess
        6.1 and will be removed in Jess 7.0. Until then, these
        warnings are harmless.
</blockquote>





<a name="mail">
<h3>1.3. Mailing List</h3>

<a name="bugs">
<h3>1.4. Bugs</h3>
</a>

      This is the first Jess 6.1 release candidate. There may still be
      bugs. Please read the <a href="release_notes.html">release
      notes</a> for specific information. Comments and bug reports
      are welcome. Contact me at <tt>ejfried@ca.sandia.gov</tt> so I
      can fix them for a later release.




<a name="assumptions">
<h3>1.5. Assumptions</h3>
</a>
Jess is a programmer's library. The library itself is written in
Java. The library serves as an interpreter for another language, which
I will refer to in this document as the Jess language. The Jess
language is very similar to the language defined by the CLIPS expert
system shell, which in turn is a highly specialized form of LISP.
<p align=""></p>
Therefore, I am going to assume that you, the reader, are a programmer
who will be using either one or both of these languages. I will
assume that all readers have at least a minimal facility with
Java. You must have a Java compiler and runtime system, and you must
know how to use it at least in a simple way. You should know how to
use it to

<ul>

<li>compile a collection of Java source files</li>

<li>run a Java application</li>

<li>deal with configuration issues like the CLASSPATH variable</li>

</ul>

If you do not have at least this passing familiarity with a Java
environment, then may I suggest you purchase an introductory book on
the topic.
<p align=""></p>
For those readers who are going to program in the Jess language, I
assume general familiarity with the principles of programming. I will
describe the entire Jess language, so no familiarity with LISP is
required. Furthermore, I will attempt to describe, to the extent
possible, the important concepts of rule-based systems as they apply
to Jess. Again, though, I will assume that the reader has some
familiarity with these concepts and more. If you are unfamiliar with
rule-based systems, you may want to purchase a text on this topic as
well.
<p align=""></p>
Many readers will want to extend Jess' capabilities by either adding
commands (written in Java) to the Jess language, or embedding the
Jess library in a Java application. Others will want to use the Jess
language's Java integration capabilities to call Java functions from
Jess language programs. In sections of this document targeted towards
these readers, I will assume moderate knowledge of Java programming. I
will not teach any aspects of the Java language. The interested reader
is once again referred to your local bookstore.
<p align=""></p>
This document contains a <a href="references.html">bibliography</a>
wherein a number of books on all these topics are listed.

<h3>1.6. Getting ready</h3>
</a>

<a name="unpacking">
<h4>1.6.1. Unpacking the Distribution</h4>
</a>

If you download Jess for UNIX, you can extract the files using tar and
gunzip:
<pre>
        gunzip Jess61p1.tgz
        tar xf Jess61p1.tar
</pre>

If you downloaded Jess for Windows, you get a .zip file which should be
unzipped using a Win32-aware unzip program like <a href="http://www.winzip.com">WinZip</a>. Don't use PKUNZIP since it
cannot handle long file names.

<p align=""></p>
When Jess is unpacked, you should have a directory named <tt>Jess61p1/</tt>.
There are two kinds of Jess distributions: <i>binary-only</i> and
<i>source.</i> Inside this directory should be the following files and
subdirectories, depending on which type of distribution you have:
<p align=""></p>

<table>

<tr>

<td><tt>docs/</tt></td>

<td>This documentation</td>

</tr>


<tr>

<td><tt>jess/</tt></td>

<td>A directory containing the <tt>jess</tt> package. There are many
source files in here that implement Jess's inference engine. Others
implement a number of Jess GUIs and command-line
interfaces. <tt>Main.java</tt> implements the Jess command-line
interface. <tt>Console.java</tt> is a very simple GUI console for
Jess; <tt>ConsoleApplet.java</tt> is an applet version of the same. If
you have a binary-only distribution of Jess, this directory will
contain only the <tt>examples</tt> subdirectory.
</td>

</tr>


<tr>

<td><tt>examples/</tt></td>

<td>A directory of tiny example Jess files.</td>

</tr>


<tr>

<td><tt>jess/examples</tt></td>

<td>A directory of more complicated examples, containing example Java source
files. </td>

</tr>


<tr>

<td><tt>jess.jar (optional)</tt></td>

<td>A Java archive file containing the Jess classes
themselves. Binary distribution only.</td>

</tr>


<tr>

<td><tt>Makefile (optional)</tt></td>

<td>A simple makefile for Jess. Source distribution only.</td>

</tr>

</table>




<a name="compiling">
<h4>1.6.2. Compiling Jess</h4>
</a>
If you have a source distribution of Jess, you have a set of Java
source files, and you'll need to compile them first before you can run
Jess. If you have a binary distribution, you can skip this section. If
you have a <tt>make</tt> utility (any UNIX-like <tt>make</tt>; you
could use the <a href="http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/">CygWin
environment</a> on Windows), you can just run <tt>make</tt> and the
enclosed Makefile will build everything. You will have to edit it a
bit first to specify the path to your Java compiler. Otherwise, you
can compile Jess by typing a few commands yourself. Using Sun's JDK on
some version of Windows, the commands
<pre>
  javac -d . jess\*.java
  javac -d . jess\awt\*.java
  javac -d . jess\factory\*.java
</pre>

would work just fine, given that <tt>Jess61p1/</tt> is your current
directory.
        <blockquote>
          
<i>
            NOTE: Jess works fine with JDK 1.4, but you will get
            warnings during the compilation about a conflict between
            the new Java keyword "assert" amd the Jess function
            <tt>jess.Rete.assert()</tt>.  These are just warnings, and
            they don't stop the compilation. This function is now
            deprecated in Jess and will be phased out over the next
            few versions.
          </i>
        
</blockquote>

<p align=""></p>
If you have problems, be sure that if you have the
<tt>CLASSPATH</tt> environment variable set, it includes '.', the
current directory. <i>Don't</i> try to compile from
inside the <tt>Jess61p1/jess/</tt> directory; it won't work.
<p align=""></p>
If you're on a UNIX system instead of a Windows system, you can use
the commands given above, but you'll need to change the backslashes
(\) into forward slashes (/).

<p align=""></p>
You must
use a Java 2 compiler to compile Jess. The resulting code
will run on any Java 2 or later VM. Jess works great with JDK 1.3.

<p align=""></p>
There are a number of optional example source files in the subdirectories
<tt>Jess61p1/jess/examples</tt>/ that aren't compiled if you follow
the instructions above. You can compile the examples one at a
time. For example, to compile the example named <tt>pumps</tt> using
the JDK on a Windows system, you can use the command
<pre>
  javac -d . jess\examples\pumps\*.java
</pre>


<hr>

<blockquote>
<b>
Again, <i>don't</i> set your current directory to, for example,
Jess61p1/jess/examples/pumps/ to compile the pumps example: it will <i>not</i>
work. The compiler will report all sorts of errors about classes not being
found and the jess package not being found. Compile everything from the
Jess61p1 directory. I can't stress this enough: this is by far the most
common problem people have in getting started with Jess!
</b>
</blockquote>

<hr>

I personally use the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/research/jikes">Jikes</a>
Java compiler from IBM. The compiler itself is very fast -- it compiles all
of Jess in just a few seconds on my machine. I highly recommend it,
and it's free!



<a name="examples">
<h4>1.6.3. Jess Example Programs</h4>
</a>

There are a few trivial example programs (in the examples/ directory)
that you can use to confirm
that you have properly compiled Jess. These include <tt>fullmab.clp</tt>,
<tt>zebra.clp</tt>, and <tt>wordgame.clp</tt>. <tt>fullmab.clp</tt> is
a version of the classic Monkey and Bananas problem. To run it yourself
from the command line, just type:

<pre>
  java jess.Main examples/fullmab.clp
</pre>

(if you've got a source distribution) or

<pre>
  java -classpath jess.jar jess.Main examples/fullmab.clp
</pre>

(if you've got a binary-only distribution) and the problem should
run, producing a few screens of output. Any file of Jess code can be
run this way. Many simple CLIPS programs will also run unchanged in
Jess. Note that giving Jess a file name on the command line is like
using the <a href="functions.html#batch"><tt>batch</tt></a> command in
CLIPS. Therefore, you generally need to make sure that the file ends
with:

<pre>
  (reset)
  (run)
</pre>

or no rules will fire. The <tt>zebra.clp</tt> and <tt>wordgame.clp</tt>
programs are two classic CLIPS examples selected to show how Jess deals
with tough situations. These examples both generate large numbers of partial
pattern matches, so they are slow and use up a lot of memory. Other examples
include <tt>sticks.clp</tt> (an interactive game), <tt>frame.clp</tt>
(a demo of building a graphical interface using Jess's Java integration
capabilities), and <tt>animal.clp.</tt> Note that <tt>animal.clp</tt>
is hardwired to expect a data file to exist in a subdirectory
examples/ of the current directory.
<p align=""></p>
In the <tt>jess/examples/*</tt> subdirectories, you will find some more complex
examples, all of which contain both Java and Jess code. As such, these
are generally examples of how to tie Jess and Java together. The
<i>Pumps</i> examples is a full working program that demonstrates how
Jess rules can react to the properties of Java Beans.



<a name="cli">
<h4>1.6.4. Command-line Interface</h4>
</a>
Jess has an interactive command-line interface. Just type <tt>java
          jess.Main</tt> (or <tt>java -classpath jess.jar jess.Main</tt>)
to get a <tt>Jess&gt;</tt> prompt. To execute a file of CLIPS code from the
command prompt, use the <a href="functions.html#batch"><tt>batch</tt></a> command:
<pre>
  Jess&gt; (batch examples/sticks.clp)
  Who moves first (Computer: c Human: h)?
</pre>
Note that in the preceding example, you type what follows the
<tt>Jess&gt;</tt> prompt, and Jess responds with the text on the next line. I will
follow this convention throughout this manual.
<p align=""></p>
You can use the Jess <a href="functions.html#system"><tt>system</tt></a> command to invoke an editor from the
Jess command line to edit a file of Jess code before reading it in with
<a href="functions.html#batch"><tt>batch</tt></a>. <a href="functions.html#system"><tt>system</tt></a> also helps to allow non-Java programmers
to integrate Jess with other applications. Given that you have an application
named <tt>xlogo</tt> on your system, try:
<pre>
  
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(system xlogo &amp;)
  <i>&lt;External-Address:java.lang.UNIXProcess&gt;</i>

</pre>
The <tt>&amp;</tt> character makes the program run in the background. Omitting
it will keep the system command from returning until the called program
exits. The <a href="functions.html#system"><tt>system</tt></a> command returns the
Java Process object representing the launched application.

<p align=""></p>
The class <tt>jess.Console</tt> is a graphical version of the Jess command-line
interface. You type into a text field at the bottom of the window, and
output appears in a scrolling window above. Type <tt>java jess.Console</tt>
to try it.


<a name="applet">
<h4>1.6.5. Jess as an Applet</h4>
</a>
The class <tt>jess.ConsoleApplet</tt> is a generic Jess applet that uses
the same display as the <tt>jess.Console</tt> class. It can be used in
general question-and-answer situations simply by embedding the applet class
on a Web page. The applet accepts two applet parameters. The value of an
<tt>INPUT</tt> parameter will be interpreted as a Jess program to run when
starting up. Note that when this program halts, the Jess prompt will appear
in the applet window. The applet also accept a <tt>COMPACT</tt> parameter.
If present, <tt>ConsoleApplet</tt> will contain only a bare-bones version
of Jess (no optional functions will be loaded).
 <p align=""></p>


<p align="">Since Jess 6 uses the Java 2 API, it won't work in the native JVM
of most deployed web browsers. Netscape 4.x and all versions of
Microsoft Internet Explorer use some version of a JDK 1.1 Java Virtual
Machine. You can use Jess 4 or 5 in these browsers, or you can require
the user to download the Java Plug-In. A full discussion of this topic
is beyond the scope of this document -- you're encouraged to get a
book that covers deploying applets on the Web if you're interested.
</p>

Note that even in Jess 4 and 5, the ConsoleApplet and ConsoleDisplay
classes use the Java 1.1 event model, which is still not supported by
some of the installed base of Web browsers; the Plug-in might still be
necessary. Don't use <tt>ConsoleApplet</tt> if you want to deploy
highly portable applets! Actually, the idea of deploying Jess as an
applet makes less and less sense these days; a much better alternative
is to run Jess on the server side (as a servlet, for example) and run
only the GUI on the client. Good applets are generally very small (a
few tens of kilobytes), while Jess's class files now occupy hundreds
of kilobytes.





<a name="good_application">
<h3>1.7. What makes a good Jess application?</h3>
</a>

Jess can be used in two overlapping ways. First, it can be a rule
engine - a special kind of program that very efficiently applies
rules to data. A rule-based program can have hundreds or even
thousands of <a href="language.html#rules"><i>rules</i></a>, and Jess
will continually apply them to data in
the form of a <a href="language.html#knowledge"><i>knowledge
base</i></a>. Often the rules will represent the heuristic knowledge
of a human expert in some domain, and the knowledge base will
represent the state of an evolving situation (an interview, an
emergency). In this case, they are said to constitute an
<i>expert system.</i> Expert systems are widely used in many
domains. Among the newest applications of expert systems are as the
reasoning part of <i>intelligent agents</i>, in enterprise resource
planning (ERP) systems,  and in order validation for electronic commerce.

<p align=""></p>
But the Jess language is also a general-purpose programing language,
and furthermore, it can directly access all Java classes and
libraries. For this reason, Jess is also frequently used as a dynamic
scripting or rapid application development environment. While Java
code generally must be compiled before it can be run, a line of Jess
code is executed immediately upon being typed. This allows you to
experiment with Java APIs interactively, and build up large programs
incrementally. It is also very easy to extend the Jess language with
new commands written in Java or in Jess itself, and so the Jess
language can be customized for specific applications.

<p align=""></p>
Jess is therefore useful in a wide range of situations. One
application for which Jess is not so well suited is as an applet
intended for Internet use. Jess's size (a few hundred kilobytes of
compiled code) makes it too large for applet use except on high-speed
LANs. Furthermore, some of Jess's capabilities are lost when it is
used in a browser: for example, access to Java APIs from the Jess
language may not work at all due to security restrictions in some
browsers. When building Web-based applications using Jess, you should
strongly consider using Jess on the server side (in a servlet, for
example.)

<a name="jess_vs_prolog">
<h4>1.7.1. Jess vs. Prolog</h4>
</a>

As in all pursuits, in programming you should choose the right tool
for the right job. Prolog and a Rete-based system like Jess are very
different.  The central concept in Prolog is backwards chaining: given
the rules

<pre>
  human(Socrates).
  mortal(X) :- human(X).
</pre>

you might be interested in knowing if <tt>mortal(Socrates)</tt> was
true.  Prolog uses the rules to find it by looking for
<tt>human(Socrates).</tt> Note that if you forget the result and ask
for it again, Prolog has to compute it again.
<p align=""></p>
The central concept in Jess, though, is forwards chaining. Here, you
have

<pre>
  
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(assert (human Socrates))
  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(defrule mortal (human ?X) =&gt; (assert (mortal ?X)))
  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(watch facts)
  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(run)
  <i> ==&gt; f-1 (MAIN::mortal Socrates)
  1</i>

</pre>

You don't specifically want to know <tt>(mortal Socrates)</tt> but
rather you want to know what happens given that <tt>(human
Socrates)</tt> is known. <tt>(mortal Socrates)</tt> is a result. After
the rule has fired, <tt>(mortal Socrates)</tt> is known, and the rule
<tt>mortal</tt> never has to assert this fact again.
<p align=""></p>

One more difference is that Prolog is really meant to be used from the
console; i.e., you're actually supposed to sit down and type
<tt>mortal(Socrates).</tt> In Jess, only developers do this; the
command line is not intended for end-users. Prolog is really about
answering queries, while Jess is about acting in response to inputs.
<p align=""></p>

Jess is different than some Rete-based systems in that it includes
both a kind of <a href="language.html#chaining">backwards
chaining</a> and a construct called <a href="language.html#queries">defquery</a> which lets you make
direct queries of the knowledge base. Both of these help Jess a better
fit for some Prolog applications, but they don't make Jess into a
Prolog-like system. Prolog is optimized, in a sense, for space, at the
cost of speed. Jess (and its Rete algorithm) is optimized for speed at
the cost of space. The Rete algorithm is all about computing things
-once- so they never need to be recomputed, and then reusing
them. Prolog's approach is targeted at exploring large numbers of
possibilities once, while Rete is aimed at exploring medium-sized
numbers of possibilities repeatedly.
<p align=""></p>

Regarding different ways to express the kinds of relationships Prolog
can express: Jess offers a rich set of possiblities. Here's one in
which the mortality is encoded directly into the facts, so it never
needs to be computed at all:

<pre>
  
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate being (slot name))
  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate mortal extends being)
  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate immortal extends being)
  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate monster extends mortal)
  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate human extends mortal)
  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate god extends immortal)

  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(defrule list-all-humanoids
    ;; fire for all beings, gods, monsters, and humans
    (being (name ?n))
    =&gt;
    (printout t ?n " is a being " crlf))

  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(defrule list-all-mortals
    ;; fires only for mortal things
    (mortal (name ?n))
    =&gt;
    (printout t ?n " is mortal " crlf))

  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(deffacts beings (human (name Bob)) (monster (name Gollum))
                          (god (name Zeus)))

  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(reset)
  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(run)
  <i>  Zeus is a being
  Gollum is mortal
  Gollum is a being
  Bob is a being
  Bob is mortal
  5</i>

</pre>

Here's another that's closer in spirit to the Prolog example.

<pre>
  
<b>Jess&gt; </b>(deftemplate thing (slot type) (slot name))

  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(deffacts things
    (thing (type human) (name Socrates))
    (thing (type mineral) (name Slate))
    (thing (type vegetable) (name Carrot))
    (thing (type dog) (name Rover))
    (thing (type human) (name Bob)))

  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(deffacts mortality
    (mortal human)
    (mortal dog))

  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(defrule list-all-mortals
    ;; fires for dogs and humans
    (mortal ?type)
    (thing (type ?type) (name ?n))
    =&gt;
    (printout t ?n " is mortal." crlf))
  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(reset)
  <b>Jess&gt; </b>(run)
  <i>  Rover is mortal.
  Bob is mortal.
  Socrates is mortal.
  3</i>

</pre>

There's a fact that expresses that humans are mortal, and one for
each human known. In this example, no extra facts are
generated. Nevertheless, the mortality of Socrates is remembered (in
the <a href="rete.html">Rete network</a>) and may be used to
optimize some later computation.






<a name="performance">
<h3>1.8. About Jess and performance</h3>
</a>

Jess's rule engine uses an improved form of a well-known algorithm
called <a href="rete.html">Rete</a> (latin for "net") to match rules
against the knowledge base. Jess is actually faster than some popular
expert system shells written in C, especially on large problems, where
performance is dominated by algorithm quality.
<p align=""></p>
Note that Rete is an algorithm that explicitly trades space for speed,
so Jess' memory usage is not inconsiderable. Jess does contain some
commands which will allow you to sacrifice some performance to
decrease memory usage. Nevertheless, Jess' memory usage is not
ridiculous, and moderate-sized programs will fit easily into Java's
default 16M heap.

<a name="hotspot">
<h4>1.8.1. Sun's HotSpot Virtual Machine</h4>
</a>

Because Jess is a memory-intensive application, its performance is
sensitive to the behavior of the Java garbage collector. Recent JVMs
from Sun feature an advanced Java runtime called HotSpot which
includes a flexible, configurable garbage collection
subsystem. Excellent articles on GC performance tuning are available
<a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/TechTips/2000/tt1222.html#tip2">
at Sun's web site.</a> Although every Jess rule base is different,
in general, Jess will benefit if the heap size and the object nursery
size are each set larger than the default. For example, on my machine,
Jess' performance on the Miranker <i>manners</i> benchmark with 90
guests is improved by 25% by increasing the initial heap size and
nursery size to 32 and 16 megabytes, respectively, from their defaults
of 16 meg and 640K. You can do this using

<pre>
     java -XX:NewSize=16m -Xms32m -Xmx32m jess.Main <i>&lt;scriptfile&gt;</i>

</pre>

Note that the object nursery is a subset of the Java heap set aside
for recently-allocated objects; the total heap size in this example is
32M, not 48M.






<a name="application_types">
<h3>1.9. Command-line, GUI, or embedded?</h3>
</a>

As we've discussed, Jess can be used in many ways. Besides the
different categories of problems Jess can be applied to, being a
library, it is amenable to being used in many different kinds of Java
programs. Jess can be used in command-line applications, GUI
applications, servlets, and applets. Furthermore, Jess can either
provide the Java <tt>main()</tt> for your program, or you can write it
yourself. You can develop Jess applications (with or without GUIs)
without compiling a single line of Java code. You can also write Jess
applications which are controlled entirely by Java code you write,
with a  minumum of Jess language code.
<p align=""></p>
The most important step in developing a Jess application is to choose
an architecture from among the almost limitless range of
possibilities. One way to organize the possibilities is to list them
in increasing order of the amount of Java programming involved.

<ol>

<li>Pure Jess language scripts. No Java code at all.</li>


<li>Pure Jess language scripts, but the scripts access Java APIs.</li>


<li>Mostly Jess language scripts, but some custom Java code in the
    form of new Jess commands written in Java.</li>


<li>Half Jess language scripts, with a substantial amount of Java code
    providing custom commands and APIs; <tt>main()</tt> provided by
    Jess.</li>


<li>Half Jess language scripts, with a substantial amount of Java code
    providing custom commands and APIs; <tt>main()</tt> written by
    you.</li>


<li>Mostly Java code, which loads Jess language scripts at runtime.</li>


<li>All Java code, which maniulates Jess entirely through its Java
    API. This option is not fully supported at this time, but will
    in a future release.</li>

</ol>


Examples of some of these types of applications are package with
Jess. The basic examples like <tt>wordgame.clp</tt>,
<tt>zebra.clp</tt>, and <tt>fullmab.clp</tt> are all type 1)
programs. <tt>draw.clp</tt> and <tt>frame.clp</tt> are type 2)
programs. The <tt>pumps</tt> example is packaged two ways. If you run
it using the script file <tt>pumps.clp</tt>, it is a type 4) program;
if you run it using <tt>MainInJava.java</tt>, it is a type 6)
application.
<p align=""></p>
Your choice can be guided by many factors, but ultimately it will
depend on what you feel most comfortable with. Types 4) and 5) are
most prevalent in real-world applications.
