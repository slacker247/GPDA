Metaclasses<br>

<p>Metaclasses are part of the way Protégé internally handles and constructs
classes. Although you might not use
metaclasses directly in your project, Protégé&nbsp; uses its default metaclasses to
build your classes and determine their properties.&nbsp; By creating your own
metaclasses and defining their slots, you can create additional templates for
your classes. This allows you to give your classes more complex properties and
to greatly extend the power of your Protégé&nbsp; projects.</p>

<p>By creating a metaclass, you create a different template which you can use
for selected classes. The new slots you create for the metaclass show up as
widgets in the Class Form for any classes that use that metaclass. This allows
you to attach additional information to your class at the class level. This is
especially useful if you have several classes, each of which has a similar
structure.</p>

<p>For example, suppose you are creating a knowledge base of wines and wineries.
In this knowledge base, a type of wine is a class, while a specific label is an
instance of that class. For your own reference, you could create a wine template
that tells you, for each class of wine, which winery is, in your opinion, the
best producer of that type of wine. Then, by applying the template to all the
wine classes, you can store that information at the class level for each type of
wine.</p>

<p><font size="3">Metaclasses are part of the SYSTEM-CLASS hierarchy, which is
included in every project. Metaclasses appear under the CLASS class. Every
subclass of a metaclass is also a metaclass. All metaclasses appear with the green metaclass
icon in the Class Relationship Pane.</font></p>

<h2>Looking at STANDARD-CLASS</h2>

<p>By default, when a class is created as part of a project, Protégé&nbsp; treats that
class as an instance of the metaclass STANDARD-CLASS. The properties of
STANDARD-CLASS create the initial view of the class and determine the properties
in the Class Form. You can look at STANDARD-CLASS to see how the slots
for a metaclass translate to properties of a class.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> Slots for STANDARD-CLASS</h3>

<p>The slots for STANDARD-CLASS are shown in the Template Slots pane when
you select the class. STANDARD-CLASS uses the standard slot types (String,
Symbol, etc.) that are used for all classes, but does so in a fairly
sophisticated way. The :NAME slot is a standard String slot which stores the
class name.&nbsp; :DOCUMENTATION is also a String slot. The :ROLE slot controls
the role of a slot and determines whether it is Abstract or Concrete, with a
default of Concrete.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/metacl2.gif" width="626" height="253"></p>

<p> The other slots are
more complex. For example, consider the :DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES slot. This slot keeps track of
the direct superclasses of a class by storing them as a list of instances.
Internal programmatic operations add and delete instances to from the
appropriate slot value whenever you make changes to a Protégé&nbsp; project. In this
way, Protégé&nbsp; represents the structure of your project using its tools for
storing and representing structure, in much the same way you create the project
structure.</p>

<p>Once you have created a metaclass, you can create all or some of the classes
in your project using the new metaclass as a template instead of
:STANDARD-CLASS. Clearly, creating a subclass of :STANDARD-CLASS and then
creating new slots or overriding existing ones vastly extends the capabilities
of your project.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> STANDARD-CLASS in the Forms Tab</h3>

<p>The widgets for each template slot on a metaclass can be viewed at the Forms Tab. In fact,
internal to Protégé , the Class Form consists of widgets
for :STANDARD-CLASS, and it could be modified using the Forms Tab.&nbsp;Look at
the Forms Tab for :STANDARD-CLASS below and see how it reflects the template
slots listed above. Note that the browser key is automatically set to :NAME.</p>

<h3>Class Form for a Class Created from STANDARD-CLASS</h3>

<p>Since any new class is by default created using :STANDARD-CLASS, the Class
Form itself reflects the structure and layout specified for :STANDARD-CLASS at
the Forms Tab. If you create a new project, then modify the Class Form at
the Forms Tab, your modifications will show up for every class, whether existing
or new.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the power of metaclasses, you may want to be particularly cautious
how much you experiment with a current project. It is a good idea to work on a
copy.</p>
