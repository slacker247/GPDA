Simple Query<br>
<img src="../classes/images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>The Queries Tab allows you to query your project and locate all instances
that match the criteria you specify.&nbsp;You can create a simple query, or
combine multiple criteria to restrict or expand your results.</p>

<p>You can create a simple query in one of three ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can specify a class, select one of the
slots attached to the class, and then specify criteria based on the slot type.
    Running the query will find the instances that
match your criteria.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
You can create a query based solely on a slot, without selecting a class.
    Running the query will find the instances that
match your criteria.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>You can create a query based solely on a class, without selecting a slot
    or any criteria. Running the query will find all instances of the selected
    class <i>and</i> all of its subclasses.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>To create a simple query:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you know the class you wish to specify, click the Select Class <img border="0" src="../classes/images/Add.gif" width="19" height="19">
    button above the Class entry bar. (If you wish to create a query based
    solely on a slot, start at Step 3.)<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/class_query.gif" width="179" height="101"></li>
  <li>Select the class you want from the Select Classes dialog box, then click OK.
    (If you wish to create a query solely on that class, you are now ready to <a href="run_query.html">run</a>
    it.)<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/select_class.gif" width="328" height="268"><br>
    The class is now displayed in the Class entry bar.</li>
  <li>Click the Select Slot <img border="0" src="../classes/images/Add.gif" width="19" height="19">
    button above the Slot entry bar.&nbsp;<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/slot_query.gif" width="172" height="74"></li>
  <li>Select a slot from the Select Slot dialog box. If you selected a class,
    only slots attached to that class are shown. If no class is selected, all
    slots are available. Click OK<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/select_slot.gif" width="328" height="229"></li>
  <li>Make a selection from the pull-down criteria menu. This menu becomes
    active after you select a slot or a class; the choices are based on the slot's Value
    Type.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Enter a value for comparison at the entry bar to the right. The entry
    method for this value depends on the slot value type.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: As mentioned above, you can create a query based solely on a slot; to
do this, skip Steps 1 and 2. You can also select the slot first and then the
class; this is useful if you remember the slot name, but are not certain of the
classes that it is attached to. To do this, select the slot as in Steps 3 and 4,
then select as class as in Steps 1 and 2. In this case, the Select Classes
dialog box will show only those classes that have the selected slot.</p>
