<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>The Form Buttons at the top right of the <a href="forms_pane.html">Forms Pane</a>
allow you to change the layout of the selected form.</p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="11%"><a name="remove"></a><img border="0" src="images/RemoveCustomizations.gif" width="17" height="15"></td>
    <td width="89%">The Remove Customizations button allows you to clear all
      customizations for the selected class form. This will return the form to
      the default layout, which has the following characteristics:
      <ol>
        <li>Widgets appear in an order based on size, type, and label.</li>
        <li>Each widget is a standard type, based on the slot's <b>type</b> and <b>cardinality</b>.</li>
        <li>Each widget is a standard size for that widget type.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In addition, when you remove customizations, any labels you have
      changed will be returned to their default labels, and any hidden widgets
      will be displayed. However, if you have changed the browser key, that will
      not be returned to the default.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="11%"><a name="default"></a><img border="0" src="images/Relayout.gif" width="15" height="15"></td>
    <td width="89%">The Default Layout button will return the selected class
      form to the default layout, based on the current information. If you have renamed any of the
      widget labels, or hidden any widgets, those changes will be retained. Any
      changes to the browser key will also be retained.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="11%"><a name="like parent"></a><img border="0" src="images/LayoutLikeParent.gif" width="15" height="15"></td>
    <td width="89%">The Layout Like Parent button will use the form layout
      designed for the superclass of the selected class. Any slots not present
      in the superclass will be placed below the superclass form in the default
      layout. Note that, if a class has more than one superclass, Layout Like
      Parent uses the layout of the superclass that is represented by where you
      are in the hierarchy. That is, if you highlight the instance of Editor
      that is under Author and click Layout Like Parent, Protégé-2000 will
      base the layout on the form for Author. If you highlight the instance of
      Editor that is under Employee and click Layout Like Parent, Protégé-2000
      will base the layout on the form for Employee.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="11%"><a name="like form"></a><img border="0" src="images/LayoutLikeOtherForm.gif" width="15" height="15"></td>
    <td width="89%">The Layout Like Form button allows you to choose a form from
      a dialog box of all forms and use that as a basis for your layout. In this
      case, any widgets the two forms have in common are laid out in the same
      way. Any widgets that appear in your current form that do not appear in
      the form you choose as a base are displayed in a standard layout below the
      chosen form. Any widgets that appear in the base form that are not in the
      current form appear as blank space in the new form.</td>
  </tr>

<p>&nbsp;You can also customize a form in a number of ways, by customizing
global properties as well as individual widgets on the form.&nbsp;See the <a href="index.html">Forms Table of Contents</a>
