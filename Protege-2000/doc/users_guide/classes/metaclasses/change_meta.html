Metaclass of a Class<br>
<img src="../images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>For any existing class in your project, you can change the metaclass you use
for that class. This gives the class and the Class Form the attributes defined
by the new metaclasses. New classes that you create as subclasses of the class
will also use the new metaclass. However, existing subclasses will continue to
use their previously assigned metaclass unless you specifically change it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This example uses the newspaper_extended project, which includes the diagram
project and tables project, both of which supply metaclass structure. You can
also use these structures in your own projects by including the corresponding
project. However, you must structure your project in a specific way in order to
be able to use these features. See the <a href="../../../tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a>
for more information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>To change the metaclass of an existing class:</p>

<ol>
  <li><font size="3">In the <a href="../class_relationship_pane.html">Class Relationship Pane</a>,
    click on the class that you want to change.&nbsp;<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/create1.gif" width="285" height="304"></font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Click the right mouse button and select &quot;Change
    metaclass...&quot;&nbsp;<br>
    </font><img border="0" src="images/change5.gif" width="261" height="187"></li>
  <li><font size="3">A dialog box displays the Concrete metaclasses, which are
    the classes you can use. You cannot use the Abstract metaclasses in this
    way. Note that if the class currently uses a non-standard class, you can
    revert to :STANDARD-CLASS.<br>
    </font><img border="0" src="images/change6.gif" width="328" height="246"></li>
  <li><font size="3">Select the metaclass that has the properties that you want
    and click OK.&nbsp;<br>
    The highlighted class will now have the Class Form and properties determined
    by the selected metaclass.&nbsp;</font></li>
</ol>
