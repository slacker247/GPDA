<p class="title">Write-up of Scan 20</p>
<p class="subtitle">Short summary of events</p>
<p class="text">A lot of various scans and attacks on the subnet until the real attack begins at packet 482 
(2002-01-08 15:19:17.4568).</p>
<p class="text">Here we see a scan over the network hosts on port 6112 which is the port of the dtspcd service.</p>
<p class="text">We see that three hosts on the net reply to the scan:</p>

<ul>
<li class="text">172.16.1.102 ACK at packet 484</li>
<li class="text">172.16.1.105 ACK at packet 493</li>
<li class="text">172.16.1.108 ACK at packet 492</li>
</ul>

<p class="text">These three hosts are probably running CDE and the dtspcd
service. The blackhat (208.61.69.153) connects to these hosts but disconnects
after a few seconds.</p>
<p class="text">Now the blackhat has pinpointed three vulnerable targets in our net.</p>
<p class="text">Some 25 minutes later at packet 526 the blackhat begins exploring
the system. By using the "follow TCP stream" utility of ethereal we can trace
the contents of the TCP session that begins here. We find the following conversation
in packets 526 to 537:</p>
<p class="listing"><span class="text">Blackhat:</span> 0000000204000d0001  4 .root..10..</p>
<p class="text">This seems to be a request to the dtspcd service, it closely
resembles the signature of the real exploit as found from the CERT advisory:
 "0000000204103e0001  4 ...10.". However the "length" boundary seems to be
reasonable in this request (0x000d) which indicates that this is not the
exploit but rather a probe of the CDE.</p>
<p class="listing"><span class="text">Honeypot:</span> 0000000014002f00013 ./ /.SPC_AAAH_aqWg. 1000.buzzy:SunOS :5.8:sun4u.</p>
<p class="text">The blackhat gets some information; hostname apparently is
buzzy, OS version is SunOS 5.8 (Solaris 8) and running on an Ultrasparc machine
(Sun4U series).</p>
<p class="text">A few seconds after this probe, the blackhat also probes
the ingreslock service of the honeypot. This is probably to see if there
is an ingreslock backdoor <a href="#References">[1]</a> already installed
on the system. Since there is no ingreslock backdoor (packets 538-539), the
blackhat proceeds at packet 540 by attacking the system with the actual dtspcd
exploit. We extract the data from this conversation and find that the blackhat
sends:</p>

<p class="text">Here we see a close match to the CERT signature of the attack
on the first two rows. The "length" indicator is 0x103e which is 0x3e bytes
more than the buffer size described in the CERT advisory. We see the shell
command that the blackhat attempts to execute on the honeypot:</p>
<p class="listing">
/bin/ksh -c echo "ingreslock stream tcp nowait root /bin/sh sh -i"&gt;/tmp/x<br>
/usr/sbin/inetd -s /tmp/x<br>
sleep 10<br>
/bin/rm -f /tmp/x<br>
</p>
<p class="text">which roughly does the following:</p>
<p class="text">Create a file with inetd.conf format specifying a remote
root shell service on the ingreslock port  (1524). Configure inetd with this
file, wait 10 seconds and then delete the config file. The method is a more
careful variation of the "bob" backdoor installation procedure outlined in
<a href="#References">[1]</a>. inetd -s apparently starts inetd outside some service manager which otherwise seems to provide some measure of security <a href="#References">[2]</a>.</p>
<p class="text">The attack is immediately repeated in packets 552 to 564,
again in packets 656 to 577 and finally in packets 578 to 594. There are
only two or three bytes that differ between the four attempts. The exploit
is presumably trying pre-set tuning of the stack overflow parameters or attempting
to overcome the effect of cacheing, thus ensuring that the exploit will work.</p>
<p class="text">Apparently the exploit is successful, at packet 589 the blackhat
successfully connects to the honeypot. We see the following conversation
between the blackhat and the honeypot in packets 589 to 840:</p>

</p>
<p class="text">As we can see, the blackhat retrieves a file via ftp (sun1)
(packets 667 to 776) which is used to replace the "login" system binary.
We can recover "sun1" with ethereal and find that it appears to be an ELF-format
binary executable. If we look at the strings inside this file we find a lot
of interesting things. One of the most interesting strings is the string
"/usr/lib/libfl.k" which is exactly the name of the "real" login executable
after the blackhat moved it out of the way for "sun1". Could it be that sun1
is a wrapper for the real login program?</p>
<p class="text">Less than half a minute after the blackhat has completed
the login replacement operation someone connects via telnet from another
system: 66.156.236.56 (packets 810 to 835). The honeypot displays the usual
"login" prompt. This could be the blackhat verifying that the honeypot appears
normal to outside visitors.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Answers:</p>
<ol>
<li class="text">A nop slide is "opcodes[..] to act as padding so execution pointer will ride up the stack to the shellcode." <a href="#References">[3]</a>, <a href="#References">[4]</a>. We have too little information about scan 10 to say how it is different.</li>
<li class="text">No, the snort signature for this exploit was inserted in exploit.rules in CVS version 1.29 dated 2002-03-02 <a href="#References">[6]</a><a></a></li>
<li class="text"><a>sh -i means that this instance of sh is interactive (talks
to stdin/stdout/stderr). sh occurs twice because of the inetd.conf format
"If a server must be invoked with command line arguments, the entire command
line (including argument 0) must appear in this field" </a><a href="#References">[5]</a></li>
<li class="text">Obviously, the commands in the payload of the exploit (/bin/ksh...)
were all "automated". However if we do a time/sequence graph (a nice feature
of ethereal) of the "ingreslock" session we see that some commands seem to
be entered manually and some seem to be "pasted" into the session.</li>
<li class="text">We believe that it is some kind of wrapper for the login program. Possibly with some connection to an irc client.</li>
<li class="text">It raised the awareness of this type of problems for our group.</li>
<li class="text">About 9 hours</li>
</ol>
<p class="text">Bonus answer</p>
<p class="text">The command <span class="listing">echo "BD PID(s): "`ps -fed|grep ' -s /tmp/x'|grep -v grep|awk '{print $2}'`</span>
prints out the string BD PID(s): and the the process ID of all processes
that have the string "-s /tmp/x" in their command-line. This is probably
used by the blackhat to check that the backdoor actually is active (i.e.
has a process running it). We believe that BD means backdoor. In this case
we see that there actually is a process (3476) running the backdoor.</p>
