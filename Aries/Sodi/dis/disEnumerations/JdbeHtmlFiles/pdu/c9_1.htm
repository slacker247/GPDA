<B>Size: </B>32<BR>

<B>Data Type: </B>Float<BR>

<B>Description: </B>This field in conjunction with the following three fields specify the beam azimuth and elevation centers and the corresponding half-angles required to describe the scan volume covered by the emitter beam scan. All angles shall be measured in relation to the emitter coordinate systems. The azimuth center for 360 degree scan systems shall be 0 degrees. It should be noted that the scan volume described does not take into account masking by the entity. Masking determinations are a part of the regeneration process and require that appropriate database information be processed by the receiving entity. This field and the following three fields shall be represented by 32-bit floating point numbers representing units of Radians.<BR>
