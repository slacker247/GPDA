<p>To create a new Protégé-2000 project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>New</strong> from the <strong>Project</strong>
    menu <i>or</i> click the New Project button <img border="0" src="images/NewProject.gif" width="16" height="15">.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Select the format you want for your Protégé-2000 files from the Select
    Format dialog and click OK.<br>
    There are three basic formats that are always displayed:<br>
    <b>Standard Text Files</b> (the default) creates project files in Protégé-2000
    format. These can also be viewed with any text editor or word processor.<br>
    <b>JDBC Database</b> creates the project as a table in a JDBC database. To
    do this you must have a database installed and configured on your system.
    See <a href="saving_a_database_project.html">Saving a Database Project</a>
    for more information.<br>
    <b>Resource Description Framework (RDF)</b> saves the project in RDF format.
    See <a href="saving_RDF_project.html">Saving an RDF Project</a> as well as <a href="../rdf_support.html"> RDF Support in Protégé-2000</a>
    for more information.<br>
    If your version of Protégé-2000 has been customized to support additional
    formats, then you will also see them in this list.</li>
  <li>An initialized knowledge base will be created which contains the system classes rooted in
    :THING. No instances will be created. You can then structure your project by
    creating your classes and slots. (See <a href="../classes/creating_a_class.html">Creating a New Class</a>
    and <a href="../slots/creating_a_slot.html">Creating a Slot</a> for more information.)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To save the project to disk, select <strong>Save</strong>
from the <strong>Project</strong> menu.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Enter a name for your project in the Project line of the dialog box. This is the
    name of your project (.pprj) file. The same name will automatically be
    entered as the name for your ontology and instance files, unless you change
    it.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>No matter which format you choose, the information specific to the Protégé-2000 interface is saved in a <b>pprj</b> (<b>P</b>rotégé <b>pr</b>o<b>j</b>ect)
file. You can create, open, and save your projects directly via the <b>pprj</b>
file. You do not need to name or access the other file types unless you wish to
build a project.</p>

<h2>Internal Project Structure</h2>

<p>Internally, there are additional files which contain further information
about the ontology and instances of the project. When you open a <b>pprj</b>
file, Protégé-2000 automatically loads these files.</p>

<p>By default, the additional files are saved in text format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a text file containing the class and slot information, given the extension <b>pont</b>
    (<b>P</b>rotégé <b>ont</b>ology).</li>
  <li>a text file containing the instance information, given the extension <b>pins</b>
    (<b>P</b>rotégé <b>ins</b>tances).</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also choose to save your project as a <a href="saving_a_database_project.html">database</a>
or in <a href="../rdf_support.html">RDF format</a>.
In the case of a database, the class/slot and instance information are saved in a single
table in a JDBC database. In the case of RDF format, the class/slot and instance information are saved
as separate RDF files. In either case, Protégé-2000 still uses the <b>pprj</b> file to
access the project.&nbsp;</p>
