# Factors:
#   a = SVbr = Pre-launch survivability (Blue on Red)
#   b = ARbr = Probability of Arrival (Blue on Red)
#   c = DMbr = Probability of Damage (Blue on Red)
#   d = SVrb = Pre-launch survivability (Red on Blue)
#   e = ARrb = Probability of Arrival (Red on Blue)
#   f = DMrb = Probability of Damage (Red on Blue)
