<p><font size="3">The Protégé-2000 User's Guide documents how to use
Protégé-2000, an integrated knowledge-base development and management system. These pages include descriptions of
the user interface along with step-by-step instructions for completing specific tasks.
Screenshots of a <a href="newspaper_example.html">Newspaper Example</a> are used to
illustrate the explanations through most of&nbsp; this guide's pages.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">We assume that you are familiar with your operating-system platform and
with using an Internet browser.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="3"> You can navigate among topics by using your browser's <strong>Back</strong>
and <strong>Forward</strong> buttons, or by using the contents list of top-level topics in
the left-hand frame. In addition, at the bottom of every page there are pointers to
related topics. There is always one link designated as &quot;Next&quot;: by
continually following this link, you can visit every page. As a
final aid for navigation, the main subsystems of Protégé-2000 include tables of
contents that list all pages associated with it, as well as a table of contents
for the project level. (<a href="classes/index.html">Classes Table of Contents</a>,
