BSn's Isearch Document-Type Suite:

First off: We too hate software that is three lines
of code and 5K of copyright, but that is the sad
shape of the contemporary Internet.

-----------------------------------------------------
Installation:
============
  Copy these files to your doctype/ directory and
add what you want to or remove what you don't want
from dtconf.inf.

-----------------------------------------------------
Description:
===========

FIRSTLINE:
  A plain text (unfielded) document type where
  the first (non blank) line is used to represent
  the headline. The headline is stored as a field
  ("headline") and is searchable--- as well as the
  whole document ("fulltext").
  This is the format of choice for plain text
  documents such as prosa and poetry.

MAILFOLDER:
  This is for Unix mail folders as well as News
  folders (articles saved by RN).

MAILDIGEST:
  Internet mail digest file format.

LISTDIGEST:
  Listserver mail digest file format.

IRLIST:
  Yet another mail digest format.

COLONDOC:
  This is not really a document type but a "major"
  class of document formats. Colon tags are among
  the most commonly used ASCII markup.
  Should the document contain several records the
  user must specify the record seperator (eg.
  " *****" for Ziff CD)

IAFA:
  IAFA has guidelines for documentation of public
  access FTP archives. This doctype handler reads
  and processes these documents.
  This is a colondoc with a "special" presentation
  to get the "Brief Headlines" right.

MEMODOC:
  This is very much like the COLONDOC type but has
  some changes to support a class of ascii memos.
  The fields/tags are, like the COLONDOC.

  Example:
     Subject: A Memo
     From: I. Search
     Date: Tue Aug 15 13:24:38 MET DST 1995

     -----

     This is a memo!


MEDLINE:
  Although this too is a "colondoc" type, we know
  alot more and handle many of the specialities of
  loads of medline as well as medline type documents.
  Record boundaries, field continuation etc are all
  handled. On BSn Isearch platforms the date of the
  document is also stored.

FILMLINE:
  This is filmline v 1.x (version 2.x is based upon
  a SGML DTD), a special document format based heavily 
  upon the Medline format. It was developed by BSn and
  JFF for interchange of film cataloging information.
  The only real difference from Medline is the semantics
  of the tags.
  This document type will NOT BE SUPPORTED to users not
  members of the German FilmNet or a national LMZ pilot
  site.

FWU *):
  This is another film interchange format used by
  educational institutions in german speaking countries
  and regions. It is maintained by the FWU in Munich.
  Since FWU import/export is controlled by the Filmline
  browser utility it is not supplied in this distribution.
  National LMZ pilot sites that require the native use of
  FWU format should NOT contact BSn but their project
  liason officer.

SGMLNORM:
  Handles SGML-type documents with "normalized" tags
  and entities, viz. end-tags and entity replacement. It
  is not a validating SGML parser. In addition to storing
  tags values as a field it also stores the values of
  (complex) attributes to allow for a relatively complete
  search and retrieval of document content.
  SGML comments and declarations are correctly handled.

HTML:
  Although a subclass of SGMLNORM it handles most all
  HTML (tag normalized or not). The only (known) limitation
  is that it does not as yet support entity expansion. For
  proper operation input documents should be entity normalized.
  Most common incorrect uses of HTML markup are also correctly
  handled. 

REFERBIB:
  This is for those refer(1) bibliographic databases.
  It has been tested against some AT&T records.
  It currently supports the concept of "Unified Field Names"
  via a `compile-time' define in the source.

GENEBANK and other Sequence file formats *):
  Currently in alpha testing. Distribution policy has not yet
  been established. Please contact BSn/Origene (origene@BSn.com)
  for information.

*) Not yet released for public distribution.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Unified Field Names:
  The %A field in refer, author in BibTeX, AU in Medline and
  Filmline are not readable. While "experts" with intimite
  knowledge of the "native" formats are at home with these
  others are not. They are also not very well suited to
  Isearch-cgi and other gateway models.
  The tags are not really field names anyway so why not
  just call "AU", "%A" etc "author". This makes it easier
  to map to USMARC anyway.
  This also will allow the development of "fielded
  relevant feedback" concepts between databases with
  different "native" formats!

TODO List:
  Put the basket of "unified field names" in a single
  place to allow for multi-national collections of
  unified names--- as well as makeing the maintainance
  of these names less error prone.
  Support "Unified Field Names" in Medline, Filmline.
  Support for BibTeX and a few other bibliographic formats
  in common use. Support for USMARC records.
  A map between "Unified Field Names" as USMARC fields.

  The map is "partially done" and should be finished in
  the next few days-- see UnifiedList.txt.
  
Should YOU have "complete" documentation on the names of
all medline tags (perhaps segmented into the flavours) please
contract me (edz@BSn.com) to "complete" the unification of
medline with other formats.


Note:
 if you select to use "filmline" YOU MUST ALSO USE "medline"
 if you select to use "html" YOU MUST ALSO USE "sgmlnorm"
 if you select to use "iafa" YOU MUST ALSO USE "colondoc"
 if you select to use "listdigest", "maildigest" or "irlist"
 YOU MUST also use "mailfolder".
