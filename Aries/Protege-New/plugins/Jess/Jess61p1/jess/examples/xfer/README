                    Store and Fetch Example
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple example of transferring Java objects between Jess and
Java using the 'store' and 'fetch' functions. The class Main is the
Java main program which drives everything; note how it provides the
Java program some input parameters using 'store', then retrieves the
results using 'fetch'. It contains an embedded Jess program; notice
how this latter program uses "fetch" and "store" to retrieve inputs
and store outputs.

To run this problem, type

        java jess.examples.xfer.Main

from the JessXX/ directory (after compiling these source files; -please-
read the part in the README about compiling Java source.)
