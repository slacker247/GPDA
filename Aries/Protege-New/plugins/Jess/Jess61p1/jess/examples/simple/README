                           Simple Java Bean
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Simple is a really trivial Java Bean that can be matched on Jess rule
LHSs because it supports PropertyChangeListeners. This is a good
example you can start from to build your own matchable classes.

Simple has properties named 'name' (a String), 'serial' (an int),
'fraction' (a float) and 'truth' (a boolean).
