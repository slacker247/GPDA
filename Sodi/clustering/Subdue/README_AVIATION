Database and some utilities to convert it to its graph format. In specific,
the dataset contains information about reports where some damage or injury
was the consequence of the report. The fields included are:

CONTENT

	FILENAME		DESCRIPTION
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	README_AVIATION		This README file.
	daminjsma		The dataset.
	airportid.txt		Airport's location file.
	mg.c			Program to convert to graph.
	cg.c			Program to create Spatio-Temporal relations.
	format_avfile.sed	Program to format the dataset to be used by
				the mg.c program.



CONVERSION TO GRAPH FORMAT

1. First, we give format to the file daminjsma so that the program that
   creates the graph can read it, we use the sed program format_avfile.sed:

  $ format_avfile.sed daminjsma

   the output will be the file: daminjsma.out

   Then we move the file daminjsma.out to the file daminjsma:

  $ mv daminjsma.out daminjsma

2. Then we run the program mg with the file daminjsma to create the graph:

  $ mg daminjsma

   The output will consist of three files:

	- daminjsma.vertex
	- daminjsma.edges
	- daminjsma.index

3. Now we create the "near_to" connections using the program cg, the file
   airportid.txt and the file daminjsma.index. We need to specify the
   output file name "daminjsma.con":

  $ cg airportid.txt daminjsma.index daminjsma.con

   The result will be stored in the file daminjsma.con

4. Finally, we put the graph together:

  $ cp daminjsma.vertex daminjsma.g
  $ cat daminjsma.edges >> daminjsma.g
  $ cat daminjsma.con >> daminjsma.g

   We are ready to use the graph file "daminjsma.g" as input to subdue.

APPENDIX: The Aviation Safety Reporting System Database 

(Taken from Aeroknowledge, "ASRS CD-ROM MANUAL, Version 1.2", Aeroknowledge,
Inc., 2425 Pennington Road Trenton, NJ, November 1994.)

We show in this appendix a description of the fields in the ASRS database. This description was taken from the "ASRS CD ROM USER'S MANUAL."


RECORD STRUCTURE
Accession Number: Unique index number that identifies each incident.
Single/Multiple Report: Indicates if the incident is a stand alone incident (SGL) or if there are several reports regarding this situation (MUL) and were combined into a single report.
Report Type: To distinguish reports that describe discrete events (OCC), recurring events (ROC), and ongoing situations (SIT).

DATE AND TIME OF OCCURRENCE
Date of Occurrence: Year and month of occurrence (e.g. "8901" means Jan 1989).
Day of Week: Day of the week of the incident (Sunday to Saturday).
Quarter of Day: The quarter of the day in which the incident happened
