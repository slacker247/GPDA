| ODBCINST lib (libodbcinst.so)                               |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

This share library supports ODBC Install/Setup and Config
options. It is modelled after MS'isms and should, therefore,
allow for an easy transition from MS'isms to other platforms
(ie Linux).

This share library, and some related share libs, also address
the issue of GUI plugability on platforms such as Linux. GUI
plugability being the fact that on Linux (and UNIX in general)
the OS; may not be running a GUI or may be supporting any number
of GUI's (X, KDE, GNOME etc).

This lib also has a command line tool called odbcinst (see
the cmd subdir).
