Subdue Graph Visualizer (SGV)

The SGV consists of a Java server and a modified Subdue client.  See the
report in SGV_report.doc for details.  To run the system on a graph file,
say 'points' with graphic annotations, first make sure the 'points' file is
in both the subdue and java directories.  Then execute:

  subdue-4.2.d.8.sgv/Subdue -display points
  java java/Server

Subdue should connect to the server and begin running, sending
substructures to be displayed to the server.
