</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CViz is a visualization tool for clustering and analysis of multi-dimensional data sets.  It is most readily applicable to data sets containing between 100 and 50,000 examples where each example has between 2 and 200 mostly numerical components (dimensions) each describing a different <I>attribute</I> of the data.  Optionally, each example may be provided with a classification value, indicating what <I>class</I> it belongs to.  Ideally, there should be between 2 and 20 different nominal classes in the entire data set.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CViz is most valuable when applied to situations where little or no information is known about the relationships between attributes and class or between different attributes.  CViz gives the data analyst a unique tool for viewing the entire set of data points across the most interesting dimensions in a short period.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CViz utilizes a k-means clustering algorithm to find interesting <I>concepts</I> in the data.  It then draws two-dimensional scatter plots by selecting pairs or triples of concepts and relating these concepts to the data examples and the other concepts.  By using an animation technique called, <I>touring</I>, CViz allows the analyst to quickly cycle through all the different pairs or triples of concepts and see how the data changes from one perspective to another.  This can often provide a unique insight into underlying structure of the data.  </P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CViz takes in flat file data in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format.  This format is easily exported from spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel.  Each line of the file should be a list of floating-point values or strings separated by commas.  In addition, the first line of the file should contain string identifiers for each attribute (column).  One specially designated column may contain the class values (strings).  This column is designated by the word &quot;class&quot; in the first row.  An example of this format is shown below:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This data set has four attributes in columns 2-5: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.  It has a class, which is represented in the first column.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Start CViz by typing &quot;run&quot; from within the CViz installation directory (optionally, you may provide the input data set as a command line argument).  For example, from the <B>File</B> pulldown menu select <B>Open Data File</B> and then select the &quot;iris.csv&quot; data set for loading.  If the file you have to load in is very large you may want to sample it instead of reading it all into memory.  To do this select <B>Open Sample of Data File</B> from the <B>File</B> menu.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the file you load in has a header describing the attribute names, a dialog will pop up asking you to select which attributes you wish to analyze via clustering as well as which attribute you would like to use for classification.</P>

<P>This scatter plot should be interpreted as follows:</P>

<OL>

<OL>

<LI>The small dots represent example points in the data set.</LI>
<LI>The icons represent cluster centroids.  The number of centroids in the plot will depend on the number of centroids entered in the <B>Num Clusters</B> field of the control panel.  </LI>
<LI>Circular icons represent the primary centroids upon which the scatter plot is based.  The axes are usually drawn through the primary cluster centroids.</LI>
<LI>Square green icons represent the other centroids.</LI>
<LI>The white &quot;+&quot; sign represents the location of the origin in the data set.  This is the point representing a zero value for all data set attributes.</LI></OL>
</OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since the example points each have four components (dimensions), this plot is not a true representation of the positions of the points in space.  Some information is lost.  What is not lost is the relative distance of each point to the primary centroids.  This is represented accurately in the scatter plot.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are four primary types of CViz scatter plots: linear, non-linear, SVD-Centroids, and simple.  Non-linear is based on two primary centroids, while linear is based on three.  The SVD plot can be based on any number of centroids greater than two.  The simple scatter plot is not based on centroids at all, but simply plots the data along two selected dimensions at a time.  Each plot displays the same information, but in a slightly different way.  The linear plot of the iris data is the one we drew first (by default).  To get a non-linear plot, select <B>Non-Linear Plot</B> in the <B>Plot Type</B> choice menu of the control panel, and then select the pulldown menu <B>Execute-&gt;New Plot</B>.  You should see a plot similar to that shown below:</P>

</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A non-linear plot is &quot;non-linear&quot; because it is based entirely upon the <U>distance</U> of every example point from the two primary cluster centroids.  Thus, the x-coordinate of each example point is calculated from its distance to one primary centroid and the y-coordinate is its distance to the other primary centroid.  The coordinates of each centroid in the scatter plot is calculated in a similar fashion.  Notice that the primary centroids are on the x and y axis, since they are zero distance from themselves.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The geometry of using the distance measure to determine coordinates dictates that some regions of the scatter plot will be &quot;off-limits&quot; to all example points.  An obvious example is the origin.  A point at the origin would have to be zero distance from both centroids, which is impossible if the centroids are not located at the same point in space.  These regions that can never contain an example point are illustrated as the gray areas in the diagram below:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image56.gif" WIDTH=222 HEIGHT=207></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most basic form of the non-linear plot is one with only two clusters.   To create a two-cluster plot set the plot type to Non-Linear and enter a 2 for <B>Num Clusters</B>.  Then select              <B>Execute-&gt;Cluster (new view)</B>.  The result should look something like this:</P>

</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A linear plot is &quot;linear&quot; because it is based on straight linear projection of each example data point on to the plane formed by three cluster centroids.  To see what this means, imagine a point in three-dimensional space.  Now imagine a plane that is a non-zero distance from that point.  The projection of the point in 3D space to the plane is the point on the plane that is closest to the point in 3D space.  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The most basic form of the linear plot is one with exactly three clusters.   To create a three-cluster plot, set the plot type to Linear and enter &quot;3&quot; in the <B>Num Clusters</B> field.  Then select:      <B>Execute-&gt;Cluster (new view)</B>.  The result should look something like this:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image51.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=450></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is important to remember with linear plots that the position of points on the scatter plot is not necessarily similar to their relative position in the original attribute space.  All that can be said with certainty is that each example’s position relative to the three primary centroids is correct.   </P>

</B></I></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A simple scatter plot is like a linear plot only it is based on viewing the data from the perspective of two selected attributes.  In this case the plane of projection is not selected via cluster centroids but is arbitrarily chosen based on setting the values of all but two attributes to zero and graphing the remaining two attributes in an x-y fashion.  In most cases this will result in much greater loss of information than a linear or non-linear plot projection.   The advantage is that it allows the user to focus in on particular attributes of interest.  To select the attributes to view, choose <B>View-&gt;Select Axes</B> after selecting <B>Simple Scatter Plot</B> from the <B>Plot Type</B> menu.</P>

The advantage is that it allows the user to focus on a set of cluster that are known to be of interest.

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The problem with projecting high dimensional data on to 2-dimensional scatter plots is that some information is usually lost.  One critical piece of information that is missing from both the linear and non-linear plots we have seen so far is how far the secondary centroids are in relation to each other in the original space.  The distance of centroids to one another is an important indicator of how similar are the concepts they represent.  Similarity lines are features that allow us to visually see this information on the scatter plot.  As an example, look at a linear plot of the iris data set with 10 clusters:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image34.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=450></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though it looks like there are defintely two &quot;meta-clusters&quot; in this picture we cannot really say beyond this which clusters are most similar (and therefore might be combined) so that we might reduce the number of clusters without losing interesting concepts.  Now click on the Similarity Lines &quot;Similarity&quot; checkbox.  The result should look something like the picture below:</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image35.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=450></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clusters that are relatively close to each other are connected with lines.  The threshold at which clusters will be connected is determined by the slider setting.  At this setting, we see that there are indeed two main cluster groups.   If we reduce the similarity threshold slider, we get a picture like the one below:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="Image36.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=450></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this similarity threshold we see three possible clustersAt this point we would want to see how the class labels are distributed across the differeng groups in order to determine the best grouping of clusters.  This is done through coloring points, as described in the next section.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If desired, the system can join the clusters connected by similarity lines into a single cluster.  This command can be executed by selecting <B>Execute-&gt; Join Similar Clusters</B>.  The result will be a reduced number of centroids equal to the number of cluster groups in the previous plot.  The new cluster centroids are calculated as the mean of all points in the group.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CViz allows the analyst to apply colors to a scatter plot to reveal the cluster, group, and class membership of each data point.  For example, if we select <B>Group Colors</B> from the <B>Colors</B> choice menu and then hit the <B>Recolor</B> button we see the following:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image37.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=450></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Notice that points whose cluster centroids are connected via a similarity line are now drawn with the same color.  The colors are chosen at random by CViz.  To select a different set of random colors, hit the Recolor button again.  To see the specific cluster that each point belongs to, select <B>Cluster Colors </B>from the <B>Colors</B> choice menu and hit <B>Recolor.</P>
</B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Finally, when the input data set provides a <I>class</I> column, we can color each data point according to its classification.  Since classification is not represented anywhere else in the scatter plot (and in fact is not even taken into consideration during k-means clustering), this information can be very valuable to display, and can be a mechanism for validating the accuracy of the clustering.  A good example of this can be seen on the iris data set by selecting <B>Class Colors</B>, setting <B>Num Clusters</B> to 3, and then selecting <B>Execute-&gt;Cluster</B>.  The result should look similar to the picture below:  </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image52.gif" WIDTH=528 HEIGHT=450></P>

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Up to this point we have focussed on using CViz to view individual scatter plots in isolation. In the case where you have only two clusters (or three in the case of a Linear plot), that is as much as we need.  Whenever the data set is partitioned into more than three clusters, however, there is a choice as to which cluster centroids will be the <I>primary centroids</I>.  This choice determines the perspective of the scatter plot.  Changing this choice will change our perspective on the data set.  Changing this perspective gradually by moving the points incrementally from one perspective to the next is called <I>touring</I>.  In a sense, we are viewing the high dimensional space from many different two-dimensional perspectives, rotating gradually as we go so that we obtain a clearer mental picture of what’s going on in the data set.</P>

This causes a <I>tour</I> to begin.  Watch how the scatter plot points move as the tour proceeds.  You may change the color scheme as the tour is going on by selecting from the colors menu and clicking on <B>Recolor</B>.  You may also add Similarity lines by clicking on the <B>Similarity</B> checkbox.  Note how the <B>Tour Location</B> scrollbar indicates the system’s progress through the major steps of the tour.

This plot can be found by clicking on the <B>Best</B> button.  The scatter plot will then rotate to the best perspective from which to view the data set as a whole.  This is not necessarily the best perspective for all purposes however.  As long as the best perspective has energy less than 1.0, other perspectives may provide additional insight.

Density and Contour graphs help to alleviate this problem by using colors to represent density of points in a given area of space.  A density graph colors it’s space based on how many example points fall exactly within a given square area of the original scatter plot.  A Contour graph does something similar, but it also smoothes out the coloring by taking into account the density of neighboring regions, when coloring a given region.

</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=3><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">CViz was the original brainchild of Dharmendra Modha, Scott Spangler, and Shivakumar Vaithyanathan.   Dharmendra worked out the underlying equations.  The software was developed in Java by Scott utilizing a K-Means clustering algorithm written previously by Shiv.  Scott also put together this user manual.  Inderjit Dhillon came up with the theory behind SVD-Centroid plots.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In developing the user interface, Scott benefited from the advice and suggestions of Mark Plutowski, and David Martin.  </P>
