<p>A Protégé-2000 project contains classes and instances. <a href="../classes/index.html">The
Classes Tab</a> is used by domain experts and knowledge engineers to create ontologies -- that is, to design
a set of classes that describe the problem domain. <a href="../instances/index.html">The
Instances Tab</a> is
used to acquire instances and is typically used by people who are neither domain experts
nor knowledge engineers. For example, a team of medical specialists could carefully craft
an ontology dealing with blood diseases. Then, nurses at a hospital could enter
instances to describe each patient.</p>

<p>How do end users enter the instances? They fill out forms. Protégé-2000 generates a
default form for every class. Protégé will attempt to create
an initial, useful set of forms based on its knowledge of the ontology. These default user
interfaces are not always user-friendly, however.</p>

<p>Forms Management solves this problem. Using the <a href="forms_tab.html">Forms
Tab</a> a developer can customize the way
the forms look and feel. The forms you create for your classes at the <a href="forms_tab.html">Forms
Tab</a> are then used to enter instances at the <a href="../instances/instances_tab.html">Instances
Tab</a>. The Forms Tab also allows you to create several user interfaces for the same ontology -- forms for knowledge acquisition can be customized for
groups of users.&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/tab.gif" width="319" height="100"></p>

<p>Each form contains a number of user-interface widgets, which correspond to
slots in the class. The currently selected widget, if any,
    is outlined in blue. Widgets are translated to entry fields
    in the <a href="../instances/instances_tab.html">Instances Tab</a>, and
    control how users will enter
    information as instances. Each slot in the class is associated with a user-interface widget on
    the form.&nbsp;</p>
