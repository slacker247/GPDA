<span class="sectionTitle">What's New?</span><br><br>

<strong><a name="differences">Big Differences</a></strong><br><br>

To follow are some significant differences between the Diagram and Graph Widgets that will be particularly 
noticeable to current users:

	<ul>
	<li>We no longer store diagram specific information such as node size and position in the onotology.  This eliminates the
	step of having to include the "diagram.pprj" project in your ontology.</li><br><br>
	<li>The Graph Widget offers two different types of connectors:<br><br>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Reified Relation</strong> - A connector between two nodes that has an underlying instance.</li>
			<li><strong>Simple Connector</strong> - A connector between two nodes that has no underlying instance.</li>
		</ul><br>
	Examples of how to create the different connectors types are available in the Getting Started tutorial.</li><br><br>
	<li>Rather than reinvent the wheel (write our own graphics library), we used a third party graphics library 
	called <a href="http://www.nwoods.com/go/jgo.htm" target="_blank">JGo</a> from Northwoods Software.  JGo has no runtime 
	fees but if you'd like to extend the GraphWidget and you need access to the JGo library, contact them to purchase a license.</li><br><br>
	<li>Rather than connecting nodes by dragging and dropping connectors from a palette, each node has a port
	in the center.  You click on the port and start dragging which causes a line to appear.  Drag your mouse over the node's
	port that you want to connect to, and the line will snap into place.  If there is more than one type of valid connector
	between two nodes, a dialog box will appear that allows you to choose which type of connector to create.</li>
	</ul>
	
<strong><a name="newFeatures">New Features</a></strong><br><br>

	<ul>
	<li>Labeled connectors.</li>
	<li>Right clicking on a connector displays a menu that allows you to insert or remove any number of points in the line.</li>
	<li>In-place text editing of node and connector labels for classes that have a designated browser key.</li>
	</ul>

<strong><a name="enhancements">Enhancements</a></strong><br><br>

	<ul>
	<li>Greatly improved selection appearance for nodes and connectors.  Primary selections are green and secondary selections
	are blue green as shown below:
	<br><br> 
	<img src="selectionColorExample.gif" alt="Selection Colors for Graph Widget" width="281" height="261" border="1"></li><br><br>
	<li>Resize handles make it much easier to resize nodes.  Each time you click on a node, eight resize handles appear along 
	the bounding rectangle of the node.  You can grab any of these handles with your mouse to resize nodes.  You can also use 
	the resize handles to drag and reposition connector points.  Examples of both are shown below:

<strong><a name="whatis">What is the Graph Widget ?</a></strong><br><br>

The Graph Widget is an alternative to <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/doc/users_guide/forms/index.html">forms</a> 
for creating and populating instances of classes in Prot&eacute;g&eacute;.  It is also particularly useful for visualizing 
networks of instances and relationships between instances.  To gain a better understanding of this definition, follow the
Getting Started tutorial offered below.<br><br><br>

<strong><a name="example">Getting Started</a></strong><br><br>

This tutorial assumes a basic working knowledge of Prot&eacute;g&eacute;.  For more information about how to use 
Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, see our <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/doc/users_guide/index.html">User's Guide</a> or 
<a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/doc/tutorial/get_started/index.html">Getting Started with Protege</a>.<br><br>

<!-- Step 1 -->
<strong><a name="downloadProject">Step 1: Download GraphWidgetExample project</a></strong><br><br>
For those of you who are familiar with Prot&eacute;g&eacute;, you'll recognize this project as a slightly modified version of the 
Newspaper example.  We'll step through the creation of an organization chart for a group of Newspaper employees.<br><br>

<a href="GraphWidgetExample.zip">Download Project</a><br><br><br>

<!-- Step 2 -->
<strong><a name="configureOrganization">Step 2: Configure Organization class</a></strong><br><br>
	<ul>
	<li>Open Prot&eacute;g&eacute; and load the GraphWidgetExample project from step 1.</li>
	<li>Choose the <code>Organization</code> class in the Relationship pane on the Classes tab.</li>
	<li>Create a new slot called <code>organization_chart</code> and attach it to the <code>Organization</code> class.  The slot 
	should be of type Instance, cardinality multiple, and have the <code>Employee</code> class as the allowed class type.  We 
	chose <code>Employee</code> as the allowed class type because an organization chart typically displays relationships between 
	employees working within an organization.</li>
	</ul>

<img src="gettingstarted_step2.gif" alt="step 2 -> configure organization class" width="913" height="682" border="0"><br><br><br>

<!-- Step 3 -->
<strong><a name="configureOrgChartSlot">Step 3: Configure <code>organization_chart</code> slot to use Graph Widget</a></strong><br><br>
	<ul>
	<li>Navigate to the Forms tab and choose <code>Organization</code> from the Forms list.</li>
	<li>Select the <code>organization_chart</code> slot and choose GraphWidget from the Selected Widget Type
	combo box.</li>
	</ul>

<!-- Step 4 -->
<strong><a name="configureNodes">Step 4: Configure node appearance</a></strong><br><br>
Nodes are the objects that appear in the palette on the left-hand side of the Graph Widget.  Each node represents a concrete allowed class
for the <code>organization_chart</code> slot (or whatever slot is configured to use the Graph Widget).  By default, the Graph Widget 
assigns all nodes the same shape and color.  To change the node shape and color or the text properties of the node's labels:

	<ul>
	<li>Double-click on the <code>organization_chart</code> slot to bring up the Graph Widget configuration dialog.</li>
	<li>Select the Nodes tab.</li>
	</ul>
	
Screenshot of the Graph Widget configuration dialog:<br><br>

<img src="gettingstarted_WidgetConfigurationDlg.gif" alt="step 4 -> configure node appearance" width="546" height="585" border="0"><br><br>
	
The table in the top portion of the Nodes tab contains a list of all the concret allowed classes for the <code>organization_chart</code> slot.  
Note that the <code>Employee</code> class does not appear here because it's an abstract class.  Rather, all the the concrete subclasses 
of <code>Employee</code> are displayed.  Try selecting various nodes from the table and changing their shape and color using the Shape 
and Shape Color combo boxes.  You can also change the text properties of the node's labels using the Text Color combo box and the Bold 
and Italic check boxes.<br><br>

You can ignore the Optional Connector Slot area as we will deal with this in a later step.  To follow is a example of what the configuration
dialog might look like after configuring node appearance:<br><br>

<img src="gettingstarted_WidgetConfigurationDlg2.gif" alt="step 4 -> configure node appearance" width="546" height="585" border="0"><br><br>

Click OK to save your changes.  <em>(Note that it is not a necessary step in this tutorial to select the same shapes and colors displayed in 
the screenshot above)</em>.<br><br><br>

<!-- Step 5 -->
<strong><a name="configureSimple">Step 5: Configure a simple connector</a></strong><br><br>
There are two types of connectors in the new version of the Graph Widget.  First we will look at the simple connector type which is a connector
between two nodes that doesn't have an underlying instance.  The allowed class type for the <code>organization_slot</code> is <code>Employee</code>.  Let's 
assume that we are interested in focusing on the <code>Editor</code> subclass of <code>Employee</code> and seeing a graphical representation of the relationship between 
editors and other employees in the newspaper organization.  There are two steps to complete for configuring a simple connector:

	<ol type="a">
		<li>Choose the <code>Editor</code> class in the Relationship pane on the Classes tab and create and attach a slot called 
		<code>responsible_for</code>.  The slot should be of type Instance, cardinality multiple, and have the <code>Employee</code> 
		class as the allowed class type.<br><br>
		Screenshot of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; after completion of step 5a:<br><br>
		<img src="gettingstarted_step5a.gif" alt="step 5a -> configure simple connector" width="908" height="640" border="0"></li><br><br>
		<li>On the Forms tab, bring up the widget configuration dialog again and select the <code>Editor</code> class on the Nodes
		tab.  Choose <code>responsible_for</code> from the Connector Slot combo box.  By making this selection, we are indicating to
		the Graph Widget that we want to be able to draw connectors between <code>Editor</code> nodes and other nodes of type <code>Employee</code>.  
		In other words, for each allowed class displayed in the table on the upper portion of the Nodes tab, the Connector Slot combo box 
		will display a list of type Instance, cardinality multiple slots for that class.  You can choose one of these slots from the combo box to 
		indicate what other class types you can draw connectors to.  Click OK to save your changes.<br><br>

		<img src="gettingstarted_step5b.gif" alt="step 5b -> configure simple connector" width="546" height="585" border="0"></li>
	</ol><br>

<!-- Step 6 -->
<strong><a name="populateSimple">Step 6: Populate an instance of the Graph Widget using nodes and simple connectors</a></strong><br><br>
In this step, we'll look at an instance of the <code>Organization</code> class and learn how to populate the Graph Widget with nodes and
simple connectors.<br><br>  

Choose the <code>Organization</code> class in the Classes pane on the Instances tab.  Select San Jose Mercury News from the 
Direct Instances pane.  To create an instance of the <code>Editor</code> class, select the <code>Editor</code> node in the palette and drag and drop it onto 
the view.  Repeat this step again so that you have two nodes in the Graph Widget view.  To draw a simple connector between the two <code>Editor</code> nodes, click 
on one of the node's ports (small dot in the center of the node) and drag your mouse to the other port.  When you release your mouse, a connector 
appears between the two nodes, showing the <code>responsible_for</code> relationship.<br><br>

<span style="margin:1%; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">Tips:</span>
	<ul>
		<li>Click and drag nodes to reposition them in the view.</li>
		<li>When a node is selected, grab any of the eight resize handles to resize the node.</li>
		<li>Since the Editor class has a browser key (the <code>name</code> slot), you can single click on the node's labels and use in-place 
		text editing to change the node's text.</li>
		<li>Double click on nodes to bring up Instance Forms.</li>
		<li>Use the &acute;C&acute; button on the Graph Widget toolbar to create nodes in the view as an alternative to dragging and dropping 
		from the palette.</li>
		<li>Select multiple nodes and click the &acute;V&acute; button to bring up multiple Instance Forms.</li>
		<li>Right click on connectors to insert extra points via the Insert Point right-mouse menu item.</li>
		<li>Right click on connectors to remove segments via the Remove Segment right-mouse menu item.</li>
	</ul>

<img src="gettingstarted_step6a.gif" alt="step 6 -> populate an instance of the graph widget" width="514" height="567" border="0"><br><br>

Continue adding nodes of various types to the Graph Widget.  Notice also that the widget will only allow you to draw valid simple connectors 
between nodes.  Since we only specified one connector slot for the <code>Editor</code> class, we can only draw simple connectors <em>from</em> 
<code>Editor</code> nodes <em>to</em> other nodes, but not the other way around.  For example, try drawing a simple connector from a <code>Columnist</code> 
or <code>Reporter</code> node to another node.  The Graph Widget won't allow such a connection.<br><br>

<img src="gettingstarted_step6b.gif" alt="step 6 -> populate an instance of the graph widget" width="720" height="711" border="0"><br><br>

<span style="margin:1%; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">Tip:</span>
	<ul><li>Use the Perform automatic layout button to automatically lay out nodes and connectors in the Graph Widget.</li></ul><br>


<!-- Step 7 -->
<strong><a name="configureRelations">Step 7: Configure a reified relation</a></strong><br><br>
In this step we will work with the other connector type provided by the Graph Widget called a reified relation.  A reified relation is a connector 
between nodes that has an underlying instance.  You use this type of connector when you need to store additional information about the relationship 
between two nodes.  There are three steps to configure a reified relation:

	<ol type="a">
		<li>Subclass the :DIRECTED-BINARY-RELATION system class.<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Choose the :DIRECTED-BINARY-RELATION system class in the Relationship pane on the Classes tab.</li>
				<li>Create a subclass called <code>Manager Supervision Relation</code>.</li>
				<li>Change the allowed class type of the :FROM slot to <code>Manager</code>.</li>
				<li>Change the allowed class type of the :TO slot to <code>Employee</code>.</li>
			</ul><br>
		What we have just defined is a class that represents a reified relation between <code>Manager</code> and 
		<code>Employee</code> nodes.  Note that you can add additional slots to this class to keep track of other 
		information about the relationship.  The screenshot below has examples of what sort of &quot;other information&quot; 
		you might want to add.  Note that it's not a necessary step in this tutorial to add additonal 
		slots to the <code>Manager Supervision Relation</code> class.<br><br>
		
		Screenshot of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; after completion of step 7a:<br><br>
		
		<img src="gettingstarted_step7a.gif" alt="step 7a -> configure a reified relation" width="998" height="695" border="0"><br><br>
		</li>
		<li>Create a slot to hold reified relations.<br><br>
		If you want to use reified relations for a particular class, you need to add a slot to the class that designates
		what the valid relations are for that class.  For our example, add a slot to the <code>Organization</code> class called 
		<code>employee_relationships</code>.  The slot should be of type Instance, cardinality multiple, and have the 
		<code>Manager Supervision Relation</code> class as the allowed class type.<br><br>
		
		Screenshot of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; after completion of step 7b:<br><br>

		<img src="gettingstarted_step7b.gif" alt="step 7b -> configure a reified relation" width="998" height="695" border="0"><br><br>
		</li>
		<li>Tell the Graph Widget which slot on your class holds reified relations.<br><br>
		
		The last step is to let the Graph Widget know which slot on your class has been created to hold reified relations.  This
		is done in the widget configuration dialog:<br><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Return to the Forms tab and bring up the widget configuration dialog.</li>
				<li>Click on the Reified Relations tab.</li>
				<li>Choose <code>employee_relationships</code> from the Relation Slots combo box.<br><br>

				<img src="gettingstarted_step7c.gif" alt="step 7c -> configure a reified relation" width="546" height="585" border="0"><br><br>

				<span style="font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">Tips:</span><br><br>
				** Use the Line Color, Line Type, and Arrowhead Type combo boxes to change the appearance of the 
				reified relation connector.<br><br>
				** Uncheck the Show Browser Text check box if you don't want your reified relation connectors to have 
				labels on them.<br><br>
				</li>
				<li>Click OK to save your changes.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

<!-- Step 8 -->
<strong><a name="populateRelations">Step 8: Populate an instance of the Graph Widget using nodes and reified relations</a></strong><br><br>
In this step, we'll look at an instance of the <code>Organization</code> class and learn how to populate the Graph Widget with nodes 
and reified relations.<br><br>  

Choose the <code>Organization</code> class in the Classes pane on the Instances tab.  Create a new instance of the 
<code>Organization</code> class called <code>San Francisco Examiner</code>.  Using the Graph Widget, create two instances
of the <code>Manager</code> class by dragging and dropping the <code>Manager</code> node from the palette onto the view.  To draw 
a reified relation between the two nodes, click on one of the node's ports (small dot in the center of the node) and drag your mouse 
to the other port.  When you release your mouse, a reified relation appears between the two nodes, showing a managerial relationship.<br><br>

<img src="gettingstarted_step8a.gif" alt="step 8 -> populate an instance of the graph widget" width="1005" height="788" border="0"><br><br>

<span style="margin:1%; font-style:italic; font-weight:bold;">Tips:</span>
	<ul>
		<li>Double click on the reified relation connector to bring up the Instance Form for the <code>Manager Supervision Relation</code> class.</li>
		<li>Designate a <a href="http://protege.stanford.edu/doc/users_guide/forms/browser_key.html" target="_blank">browser key</a> for the <code>Manager Supervision Relation</code> class to enable in-place editing of the 
		reified relation connector's label.  (One possibility would be to attach the <code>name</code> slot).</li>
		<li>On the Forms tab, set the Selected Widget Type for the <code>employee_relationships</code> slot to &lt;none&gt; to expand 
		the amount of display for the Graph Widget.</li>
	</ul>

Continue adding nodes and experimenting with reified relations.  To follow is a screenshot of the San Francisco Examiner Instance Form 
after adding more nodes, reified relations, a simple connector, and completing the tips specified above:<br><br>

<strong><a name="convertToGraph">Converting from the Diagram Widget to the Graph Widget</a></strong><br><br>
To follow are some notes (courtesy of <a href="mailto:tu@smi.stanford.edu">Samson Tu</a>) on how to convert existing instances of the Diagram Widget to the Graph Widget.<br><br>

Assumptions:
<ul>
	<li>You've installed Prot&eacute;g&eacute; version 1.8, build 1032 or later.</li>
	<li>You're interested in saving existing diagrams.</li>
	<li>You're using a file system back-end.</li>
</ul>

<em><span class="green">1st Scenario:</span></em><br><br>

You have a project that includes the diagram ontology, that has a number of diagram instances, and you do not need to use the 
existing location information of nodes and connectors.

<ol>
	<li>Make the <code>:DIRECTED-BINARY-RELATION</code> class the parent class of your classes that inherit from the diagram 
	widget <code>Connector</code> class.  Your existing subclasses of the <code>Connector</code> class will then inherit 
	the <code>:FROM</code> and <code>:TO</code> slots from the <code>:DIRECTED-BINARY-RELATION</code> class.</li>
	<li>In your existing subclasses of the Network class, add a multi-valued slot (you can choose your own name), whose allowed 
	classes include the allowed classes of the existing <code>connectors</code> slot.  This slot will be used to hold arc 
	information in the new Graph Widget.</li>
	<li>Save the project.</li>
	<li>Open the pins file in a text editor.</li>
	<li>Globally replace <code>first_object</code> with <code>:FROM</code> and <code>second_object</code> with 
	<code>:TO</code> (assuming that you are not using the <code>first_object</code> or <code>second_object</code> slots for 
	anything else).</li>
	<li>Rename the slot <code>connectors</code> in your instances that hold the diagram to the new slot you've defined in 
	step 2.</li>
	<li>Save the pins file.</li>
	<li>Reload the project.</li>
	<li>Change the metaclasses of your old <code>Connector</code> and <code>Network</code> classes to <code>:STANDARD_CLASS</code> 
	(or any metaclass your want).</li>
	<li>Drop <code>Connector</code> and <code>Network</code> classes as parents of your classes.</li>
	<li>Delete instances of <code>ObjectLocation</code>, <code>Rectangle</code>, and <code>Point</code>.</li>
	<li>In the Forms tab, configure appropriate classes and slots in your project (that used to be shown as diagrams) to use the 
	new Graph Widget.</li>
</ol>

Do not &quot;uninclude&quot; the diagram project from your own project until you have converted all projects that include 
the project where you specify the classes that make use of the diagram ontology.<br><br>

<em>2nd Scenario:</em><br><br>

You have a project (Project A) that includes another project (Project B) where diagrams are configured and you do not need to use 
the existing location information of nodes and connectors.

<ol>
	<li>Convert Project B where you specify the classes that make use of the diagram ontology (see 1st scenario above).</li>
	<li>In a text editor, open the pins file for Project A.  Globally replace <code>first_object</code> with <code>:FROM</code> and 
	<code>second_object</code> with <code>:TO</code> (assuming that you are not using the <code>first_object</code> or 
	<code>second_object</code> slots for anything else).</li>
	<li>Rename the slot <code>connectors</code> in your instances that hold the diagram to the new slot name you've defined.</li>
	<li>Save the pins file.</li>
	<li>You may have to reconfigure the classes of Project A in the Forms tab so that the Graph Widget gets used appropriately.  
	Alternatively, you can &quot;import&quot; the pont and pins files to rebuild the pprj file.  When a new pprj file is built, 
	Prot&eacute;g&eacute; will copy the widget configuration information from included projects.</li>
</ol><br>

<strong><a name="bugs">Known Bugs</a></strong><br><br>
	<ul>
	<li>There are some cases where the positioning information is lost for nodes and connectors the first time you click away from 
	a new instance of the graph widget.  The workaround for this bug is to click away from new instances of the graph widget and come 
	back to them before beginning to populate them with new nodes and connectors.</li>
	</ul>

<strong><a name="wantedFeatures">Known Feature Requests</a></strong><br><br>
	<ul>
	<li>An additional arrowhead type of circle</li>
	<li>The ability to designate arrowhead type for source arrowhead (can only specify destination arrowhead now)</li>
	<li>The ability to control the color of nodes based on the value of a specified slot</li>
	<li>Copy and paste for nodes within an instance of the graph widget</li>
	<li>Copy and paste for nodes between different instances of the graph widget</li>
	<li>Color chooser dialog to allow for a greater selection of node and connector colors in the widget configuration dialog</li>
	</ul>
