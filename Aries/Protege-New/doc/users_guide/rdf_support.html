<h1>
RDF Schema Support in Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000</h1></center>
For version 1.5 of Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000, we have re-implemented our
<a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF
(Schema)</a> support in order to make it more stable and to make it easier
to implement other RDFS-based backends such as <a href="http://www.ontoknowledge.org/oil/">OIL</a>
and <a href="http://www.daml.org/">DAML</a>. Furthermore, several features
were added, such as
<ul>
<li>
in addition to a round-trip version, you can export as simple RDF(S) (i.e.,&nbsp;
Prot&eacute;g&eacute; specific facets are not encoded in additional triples);</li>

<li>
support for namespace abbreviations (frame names are never prefixed with
complete URIs, only with abbreviations);</li>

<li>
when exporting a project that has included projects, you can put the included
projects into different namespaces (see the section "Renaming the (default)
namespaces of included projects" below).</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://smi-web.stanford.edu/projects/protege/protege-rdf/protege-rdf.html">Here</a>
you will find a comparison of the RDF(S) and Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000
models.
<h2>
Importing, creating, and saving RDF(S) files</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<font size=+0>To import your existing RDF(S) files into Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000
select the <b>Project | Import</b> menu item and select <i>RDF Schema</i>
from the storage format dialog.&nbsp; Enter the name of the file containing
your RDF schema and the name of the file containing your RDF instance data
in the appropriate fields.</font></li>

<li>
To create a new RDF project, which will include the schema and the instance
data, select the <b>Project | New</b> menu item and select <i>RDF Schema</i>
from the storage format dialog.</li>

<li>
An existing Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-2000 project can be saved as an RDF(S)
project by selecting the <b>Project | Save In Format </b>menu item and
selecting <i>RDF Schema</i>&nbsp; from the storage format dialog. If you
check <b>plain RDFS</b>, no Prot&eacute;g&eacute; specific facets are exported.</li>

<li>
You can use <b>Project | Save in Format...</b> to export a project using
the old backend into a project using the new one (don't use <font size=+0><b>Project
| Import </b>for this since the new backend uses different encodings for
</font>Prot&eacute;g&eacute;
specific facets).</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Renaming the (default) namespaces of included projects</h2>
This feature can be used to transform an existing (Standard Text File/CLIPS)
project into an RDF(S) one where frames from included projects reside in
<i>different</i>
namespaces (you can also achieve the reverse effect, i.e. forcing all (or
some) projects to share a namespace or have the same namespace as the main
project). Here is how it works:
<ol>
<li>
Transform the project into an RDF(S) one where <i>all</i> projects (main
and included ones) have the <i>same</i> default namespace. You need to
do this "bottom up", i.e., for the included projects first, and finally
for the main one. Make sure you save all files with new file names (or
in a new directory), or the main file does not load any more (since it
will already try to load the new included projects)!</li>

<li>
Load the new main project and click <b>Project | Save as ...</b>. If you
have included projects that were loaded with the RDF(S) backend, you will
see an <b>Advanced ...</b> button. Change some or all of the namespaces
and save (the console window will show a remark if namespaces of included
projects are renamed). Close the project.</li>

<li>
For each of the included projects for which you have renamed the default
namespace, load and change the namespace (via <b>Project | Save as ...</b>).</li>

<li>
You can now load the main project.</li>
</ol>

<h2>
Example</h2>
A simple example is in the <i>Protege-2000/examples/rdf</i> directory.
<h2>
Known bugs and problems</h2>

<ul>
<li>
only the RDF Schema namespace http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/PR-rdf-schema-19990303#
is supported when saving (on import, the new namespace is also recognized)</li>

<li>
rdfs:seeAlso, rdfs:isDefinedBy, rdfs:label, container, and reified statements
are not supported</li>

<li>
multiple types for a single resource are not supported</li>

<li>
you cannot make changes to the standard meta classes (i.e., rdf:Resource,
rdf:Property, rdfs:Class, etc.)</li>

<li>
XML Schema data types are not recognized as rdfs:Literal (but it is unclear
if they should)</li>
</ul>
