Class Using a
Metaclass<br>
<img src="../images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p><b>Note: </b>Before you create and use metaclasses, you should be confident
with the basic Protégé interface and be comfortable designing a project, and
creating and modifying classes, slots, forms and instances.</p>

<p>Once you have added one or more metaclasses to your project, either by
creating them directly, or by including a project that already has metaclasses,
you can select the metaclass you want to use to create a class. When you create
a class using a non-standard metaclass, the class is given the attributes
specified by the selected metaclass.&nbsp;Unless you make changes, every new
subclass you create for the class will also use the selected metaclass.</p>

<p>This example uses the wines project, which includes a Wine template that
supplies metaclass structure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you create a class using the Create <font size="3"><img border="0" src="../images/Create.gif" width="12" height="16">
</font> button, you will use the metaclass of the direct superclass as the metaclass for
the new class. Unless you have made changes, this is the default :STANDARD-CLASS.</p>

<p>To create a class using a non-standard metaclass:</p>

<ol>
  <li><font size="3">In the <a href="../class_relationship_pane.html">Class Relationship Pane</a>,
    find the class that you want as the superclass of the new class.&nbsp;<br>
    </font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Click the right mouse button and select &quot;Create
    subclass using metaclass...&quot;&nbsp;<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/create2.gif" width="259" height="183"></font></li>
  <li><font size="3">A dialog box displays the Concrete metaclasses, which are
    the classes you can use when creating a class. You cannot create a class as
    an instance of an Abstract metaclass.<br>
    </font><img border="0" src="images/create5.gif" width="325" height="171"></li>
  <li><font size="3">Select the metaclass that has the properties that you want
    and click OK.&nbsp;<br>
    The new class will be added under the highlighted
    class. It will have the Class Form determined by the selected metaclass. The
    name of the metaclass you used is displayed at the top of the Class Form,
    immediately after the name of the class. The Class Form may include additional widgets that are not part of :STANDARD-CLASS.<br>
    </font><img border="0" src="images/create6.gif" width="931" height="505"></li>
  <li><font size="3">Use the <a href="../class_form.html">Class Form</a> to name the class, choose its role, create constraints, and create and edit
    slots.&nbsp;</font></li>
</ol>
