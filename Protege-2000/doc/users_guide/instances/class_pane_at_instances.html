<p>The Class Pane at the <a href="instances_tab.html">Instances Tab</a> shows
the classes in your knowledge base in a superclass/subclass relationship. By
navigating through the classes, you can select the class whose instances you
wish to see.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/ClassInstance.gif" width="186" height="257"></p>

<p align="left">
Subclasses appear below their superclasses and indented to
the right. Classes with more than one superclass appear more than once in the tree. All classes are shown as descending,
directly or indirectly, from the system class <strong>:THING</strong>.</p>

<p align="left">
The View <img border="0" src="images/View.gif" width="17" height="18"> button
opens the <a href="../classes/class_form.html">Class Form</a> for the
highlighted class and allows you to view or edit the class properties. See <a href="../classes/editing_a_class.html">Viewing a Class</a> 
for more information.</p>
<p align="left">The <b>numbers</b> to the right of a class give information
about the number of direct instances that class has. For example, <b>Editor</b> has 4
instances. When a class with instances is selected, the instances are shown in
the <a href="instances_pane.html">Direct Instances Pane</a>. If there is no
number, the class does not have any instances. Abstract classes (<a href="class_pane_at_instances.html#abstract">see
below</a>) cannot have instances; concrete classes may or may not have
instances.</p>

<p>The Class Pane at the Instances Tab uses icons to give information about the structure of your knowledge base
and the nature of your classes. See the <a href="../classes/class_icons.html">Class
Icons</a> for more information.</p>
