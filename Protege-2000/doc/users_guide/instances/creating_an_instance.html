<p>Creating instances is part of the iterative process of developing a Protégé-2000
project. Before you create instances, you need to have created and organized the
classes and slots that model your knowledge base structure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Creating instances can give you valuable information about the project
structure and its applicability. As you add instances to your project, you may
expose missing or redundant areas which tell you that you need to redesign some
of the class/slot structure. However, as you move classes and create and delete
slots, you may lose information in your instances. In addition, it is difficult
to split a single instance into two or more instances. Therefore, you should not add
an extensive base of instances until you believe the structure of your project
is fairly stable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two ways to create an instance:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You can create an instance directly, from the <font size="3"> <a href="instances_pane.html">Direct
Instances pane</a>. This is described below.</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">You can create an instance from an <a href="standard_fields.html#Instance">Instance
    </a> <a href="standard_fields.html#Instance">Field</a>  for another instance. See <a href="creating_a_widget_instance.html">Creating
an Instance From a </a> <a href="creating_a_widget_instance.html">Field</a>.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="3">Creating an instance from the <a href="instances_pane.html">Direct
Instances pane</a> creates the instance directly in the selected class. To
create a new instance from the <a href="instances_pane.html">Direct Instances
pane</a>:</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font size="3">In the <a href="class_pane_at_instances.html">Class Pane at
    the Instances Tab</a>,
    highlight the class where you want the instance to appear.&nbsp;<br>
    </font><img border="0" src="images/creati5.gif" width="217" height="297"></li>
  <li><font size="3">Click the <strong>C(reate)</strong> button, which appears
    as a <img border="0" src="images/Create.gif" width="12" height="16">
    in the <a href="instance_buttons.html">instance buttons</a>  at the right of the
    <a href="instances_pane.html">Direct Instances pane</a>. The new instance will
    appear in the Direct Instances pane. It will have a default name, such as
    project_INSTANCE_00001.<br>
    </font><img border="0" src="images/creati6.gif" width="234" height="225"></li>
  <li><font size="3">Use the <a href="instances_form.html">Instances Form</a> at
    the right to fill in the slots for the instance.&nbsp;</font></li>
</ol>
