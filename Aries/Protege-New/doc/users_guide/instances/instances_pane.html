<h1><img src="images/writing_nerd.gif" WIDTH="48" HEIGHT="48"> The Direct Instances
Pane <br>
<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>The Direct Instances pane shows all the direct instances, if any, for the class
selected in the <a href="class_pane_at_instances.html">Class Pane at the
Instances Tab</a>, and allows you to view, edit, create, and delete direct instances.</p>

<p> A <i>direct
instance</i> is an instance that has been created directly under the class. However,
because of inheritance, an instance of a class is also an
instance of all that class's superclasses. Therefore, an instance can be an instance
of many classes; however, it can only be a <i>direct</i> instance of a single
class.</p>
<p>This pane has three components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <a href="instance_buttons.html">Instance Buttons</a> allow you to
    create, edit, and delete instances.</li>
  <li>The <a href="instances_pane.html#The Instances Window">Instances Window</a> displays an
    alphabetical list of the instances for the selected class.</li>
  <li>The Instance Lookup Bar allows you to locate an instance in the Instances
    Window by typing the instance name and clicking the binoculars. See <a href="finding_an_instance.html">Finding
    an Instance</a> for more information.</li>
</ol>

<p align="left">When a single class is selected in the <a href="class_pane_at_instances.html">Class
Pane at the Instances Tab</a>, the Instances Window shows all the instances
belonging to that class. Instances are displayed in alphabetical order by the
text in the browser key, which is the slot that has been designated as the
identifying slot for the class. If no browser key has been selected, Protégé-2000
uses a default key, &lt;instance name&gt;, which is displayed as a number, such
as newspaper_0017. See <a href="../forms/browser_key.html">The
Browser Key Menu</a> for more information.</p>
<p align="left">When a single instance is selected, the information for that
instance is shown in the <a href="instances_form.html">Instances Form</a> to the
right.</p>
<p align="left">The color of the icon to the left of the instance name gives
information about the instance:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="11%"><img border="0" src="images/Instance.gif" width="15" height="15"></td>
    <td width="89%">The instance can
be edited. You can enter your edits directly to the right, or click the View <img border="0" src="images/View.gif" width="15" height="15">
      button to open the <a href="instances_form.html">Instances Form</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td width="89%">The instance cannot
be edited. Instances cannot be edited if they are
included from another project. See <a href="../projects/including_a_project.html">Including
      a Project</a> for more information.</td>
