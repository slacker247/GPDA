Metaclass of Subclasses<br>

<p>When you change the metaclass of a class, all of its subclasses will retain
their previous metaclass. This ensures that you do not propagate changes when
you do not want to. However, often you will want existing subclasses to have the
same metaclass as their parents. Protégé provides an option to quickly change
the metaclasses of all the classes subordinate to a given class. Note that you
only have to do this once; by default, new classes use the metaclass of their
direct superclass.</p>

<p>You can only change the metaclasses to match the metaclass of the selected
class. If the selected class has :STANDARD-CLASS as its metaclass, all
subclasses will lose any additional metaclass st</p>

<p>To do work with metaclasses, you must have added one or more metaclasses to your project, either by
creating them directly, or by including a project that already has metaclasses.
The screenshots in this section use the newspaper_extended project, which includes
metaclass structure. You can use these structures in your own projects. See the <a href="../../../tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a>
for more information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
