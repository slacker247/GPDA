The EMACSINFO doctype


Format:

The EMACSINFO doctype expects files of the following format:

File: filename Node: nodename
This is some text associated with the above File: and Node: names
This is another line
File: newFilename Node: newNodeName
This is the next record and contains text associated with the new File
and Node names.

We use the "File:" tag to indicate the start of a section, and we assume
a section runs either to the next starting point or to the end of the
file.

We mark the "File:" and "Node:" contents as the "file" and "node" fields,
respectively.  Thus you can search for "node/Bugs" if you want to.

The present method can show either the File: and Node: line of a record,
or it can show the entire record.  We've elected to show the entire File:
line, but this is somewhat arbitrary.  If you're indexing things like
the gcc compiler help then the File: lines can be mighty long, but
they contain a lot of important information.  Again, if this proves to
be a big problem, let us know.  It's easy to make a "file" only and "node"
only present if you really want that.
