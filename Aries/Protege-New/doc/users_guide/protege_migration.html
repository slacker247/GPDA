<p>First, make sure that you really want to migrate to Protégé-2000. There is no going
back. File formats for Protégé-2000 are different from those of Protégé/Win.
Protégé/Win can still read pont files that do not use inclusion, but that's the extent
of compatibility between the two systems.</p>

<p>Follow the following simple steps to convert your Protégé/Win files into
Protégé-2000 projects.</p>

<p>A. Make sure that there are no class/slot name conflicts:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small>In Protégé-2000, slots and facets are global objects whose names must be
  distinct from names of other global object, such as classes. Protégé-2000 handles name
  conflicts by appending &quot;_&quot; to class names. Thus, make sure that such name
  conflicts do not occur in your ontology and among the ontologies that you include.
  Ultimately, when you are including ontologies from different sources, name conflict is
  difficult to avoid.. A future version of Protégé will support distinct name spaces for
  projects.</small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>B. If you use ontology inclusion in Protégé/Win, determine the inclusion relationship
among your pont files. Protégé-2000 uses the notion of <em>projects</em>, which points
to the pont and pins files and other included projects. You must convert pont and pins
files included in other projects before converting the including projects.</p>

<p>C. Launch Protégé-2000. Use &quot;<b>Import Project...</b>&quot;
on the <b>Project</b> menu and select <i>Standard Text Files</i> in the Select
Format dialog box to convert a pont and pins file into a Protégé-2000 project.
(See <a href="projects/building_a_project.html">Importing a Project</a>
 for more information.) You will have to
re-custom-tailor the layout of your instance editor. (See Figure 1)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small>See Figure 1. You must have a pont file to use Import Project. If you have a pont file
  but no pins file, then leave the pins file entry blank.. If you have converted files that
  you want to include into their own Protégé-2000 projects, you can select them and put
  them in the &quot;Included Projects&quot; window. Up to version 0.911, all pont, pins, and
  project files that are related through inclusion must be located in the same directory.</small></p>

</blockquote>

<p>D. When you are ready to save the project, select <b>Save</b> from the <b>Project</b>
menu. A dialog box
allows you to type in or select the project name and names of the pont and pins file. All
three files should be (and will be, if you just type in the project name) saved in the
same directory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>E. If you&nbsp; have a pins file based on ontologies defined in other projects, create
a new project that includes the necessary ontology, save the project with empty pont and
pins files, and then rename your pins file to be the pins file of the project.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><small>When you save the empty pins file, make sure that your real pins file has a
  different name; otherwise your pins file will be overwritten.</small></p>
