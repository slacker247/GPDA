The ONELINE doctype

Format:
The ONELINE doctype expects files in the following format:

This is a document.
Thi is another document.
You see, each line is a document.

There is no special handling of present.  Any element set name will cause
the entire line to be presented.  There are no searchable fields.

This doctype is really handy for things like phonebooks.
