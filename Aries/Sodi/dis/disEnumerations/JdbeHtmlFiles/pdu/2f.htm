<B>Size: </B>16<BR>

<B>Data Type: </B>Unsigned<BR>

<B>Description: </B>Each simulation application at a DIS site shall be assigned an application identifier unique within that site.  No simulation application shall be assigned an id containin all zeros, (2e16-1), or (2e16-2).  One or more simulation applications may reside in a single host computer.  The mechanism by which application IDs are assigned is outside the scope of this standard. <BR>

The simulation manager shall use the reserved application IDs to identify receivers of Simulation Management PDUs.  An application ID equal to zero shall mean no application.  An application ID equal to all ones (2e16-1) shall mean all applications; theis may be used to start all applications within a site.  An application ID equal to (2e16-2) shall have no meaning but is reserved for consistency.<BR>
