<p><BR><H4>Receiver PDU</H4>

<B>Size: </B>288<BR>

<B>Description: </B>Communication of receiver state shall be communicated with a Receiver PDU. The Receiver PDU shall contain the following fields:<BR>

<BR>

a) PDU Header - This field shall contain data common to all DIS PDUs. The PDU Header shall be represented by the PDU Header described in 5.3.24.<BR>

b) Entity ID - This field shall identify the entity that is controlling the radio transmission. The source entity may either represent the radio itself or represent an entity (such as a vehicle) which contains the radio. This field shall be represented by an Entity Identifier Record (see 5.3.14).<BR>

c) Radio ID - This field shall identify a particular radio within a given entity. Radio Ids shall be assigned sequentially to the radios within an entity, starting with Radio ID 1. The combination of Entity ID and Radio ID uniquely identify a radio within a simulation exercise. The Radio ID field shall be represented by a 16-bit unsigned integer.<BR>

d) Receiver State - This field shall indicate the state of the receiver, which shall either be idle or active. This field shall be represented by a 16-bit enumeration (see Section 9 in EBV-DOC).<BR>

e) Received Power - This field shall indicate the RF power received, after applying any propagation loss and antenna gain. This field shall be represented by a 32-bit floating point number in units of decibel-millwatts (dBm).<BR>

f) Transmitter Entity ID - This field shall identify the entity that is the source of the transmission that is currently being received. The selection of the received transmitter depends on the characteristics and state of the simulated receiver. This field shall be represented by an Entity Identifier Record (see 5.3.14).<BR>

g) Transmitter Radio ID - This field shall identify the particular radio within the entity cited in paragraph f) that is the source of the radio transmission. The Transmitter Radio ID shall be represented by a 16-bit unsigned integer.<BR>
