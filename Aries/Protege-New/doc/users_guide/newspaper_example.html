<p>Throughout this guide, we provide examples and screenshots from a fictitious
&quot;newspaper&quot; example. We designed this example to be intuitive. This example is
available under the examples directory in the Protégé-2000 directory.</p>

<p>There are a variety of possible uses for a knowledge base of newspaper data. Our
example knowledge base includes:

<ul>
  <li>A list of all published articles, indicating when published, in what section, etc.</li>
  <li>Information about standard sections of the newspaper (Sports, Lifestyle, Business,
    etc.)</li>
  <li>Employee information</li>
  <li>Advertising information</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a variety of applications that might use information in this knowledge
base. For example, one could build:

<ul>
  <li>A system for retrieving, organizing and answering queries about published articles</li>
  <li>A system for analyzing advertisement revenues or pricing</li>
  <li>A system for reviewing the organization of the employees that makes sure that
    reporters are balanced appropriately among editors, and that all sections of the newspaper
    have a responsible editor</li>
</ul>

<p>As this is an artificial example, we have not built any of these applications, but
we hope this example will give a flavor of how knowledge bases, ontologies, and
knowledge-acquisition tools can be designed with Protégé-2000.&nbsp;</p>
