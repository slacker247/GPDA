<p>The Class Relationship Menu allows you to choose which relationship between classes
is represented in the <a href="class_relationship_pane.html"> Class Relationship
pane</a>. The following choices are available:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Superclass</b>: Displays all the classes in your project in a subclass-superclass relationship.
    This is the default.</li>
  <li><b>Reference</b>: Displays all the slot reference relationships. </li>
  <li><b>Slot reference relationships</b>: When a class is selected, each of its slots of type <b>Class</b> or <b>Instance</b>
    appears separately on the menu. Selecting the slot name displays classes
    which are reference through the slot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The picture below shows the Class Relationship menu for the class <b>Editor</b>
in the Newspaper example. <b>Editor</b> has two <b>Instance</b> slots, <b>responsible_for</b> and <b>sections</b>. Other
    classes might show more slots, or only the <b>Superclass</b> and <b>Reference</b>
choices.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/superclass_menu.gif" width="180" height="106"></p>
<p align="left">Certain actions can be performed in the <b>Superclass</b> relationship view <i>only</i>. These include creating a new class and
rearranging the hierarchy using drag-and-drop.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;The view in the <a href="superclasses_pane.html">Superclasses
pane</a> does not change to reflect the choice on the Relationship menu.</p>
<h2><a name="Subclass">Superclass</a></h2>

<p>The default <b>Superclass</b> relationship displays the subclass-superclass structure of your knowledge base.
All the classes in the knowledge base appear in the displayed tree. (Some
classes may be hidden. You can choose
      whether or not hidden classes are displayed in the Class Relationship pane
      by choosing <b>Configure</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu, going to the <b>Display</b>
      tab, and toggling the <b>Display Hidden Classes</b> option.) The <b>Superclass</b>
view gives you an overall picture of the class structure. This choice is always
shown on the menu.</p>

<h2><a name="Reference">Reference</a></h2>

<p>The <b>Reference</b> relationship displays the hierarchy of classes, starting
at the selected class, that are related to each other through any of the slots
for the class. The <b>Reference</b> view thus shows the union of all the <a href="viewing_referenced_classes.html#Reference">slot
reference relationships</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="Selected Slots">Slot</a><a name="Selected Slots">  Reference Relationships</a></h2>

<p>If you select a class in <b>Superclass</b> view, the Class Relationship menu
will list all the slots of type <b>Class</b> or <b>Instance</b> for that slot.
Selecting a slot from the menu will show the hierarchy of classes, starting at
the selected class, that are related to each other through the slot selected on
the menu.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, the class <b>Editor</b> in the <b>Newspaper</b> example has the <b>Instance</b>
slot&nbsp;<b>  supervises</b>. The only <a href="../slots/value_type_menu.html#Instance">allowed
class</a> for this slot is the class <b>Employee</b>. This is what is shown when
<b>supervises</b> is selected.</p>

<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/viewin5.gif" width="201" height="78"></p>

<p>In more complex knowledge bases, the displayed tree might be more extensive.
Multiple classes can be related to the original class through the slot. A class
that is related to the selected class through the slot might itself have that
slot, and then its related classes would appear in the tree. This allows for a
complex hierarchy that diagrams the slot relationship between classes.</p>

<p>The different views can be read as &quot;parent-relationship-child,&quot;
where &quot;relationship&quot; is displayed on the <b>Relationship</b> menu. For
example, in the <b>responsible_for</b> 
view, <b>Editor</b> - is <b>responsible for</b> - <b>Employee</b>. Similarly, in
the <b>Superclass</b> view, <b>Employee</b> - is a <b>superclass</b> of -&nbsp;<b> Employee</b>.</p>

<p>It is also possible to view a
list of all the frames that reference a highlighted class using the
Back-References <img border="0" src="../images/BackReferences.gif" width="13" height="13"> class button. See <a href="viewing_backreferences.html">Viewing
Back-References</a> for more information.</p>
