<p><BR><H4>Padding -6bits Field</H4>

<B>Size: </B>6<BR>

<B>Data Type: </B>Pad<BR>

<B>Description: </B>This field does not appear in 1278.1-1995 or its assoicated EBV document.  However, an error has been discovered in the Entity Appearance Specific definition of the Platforms of the Land Domain.  The EBV doc assigns bit 24 as Tent and bit 25 as ramp, but also assigns bits 24-31 as the field Entity Specific which is unused.  To correct this problem a 6bit pad has been introduced into the definition which redefines the field Entity Specific to bits 26-31.<BR>
