"Some of the dancers have been away on holiday and look more like lobsters than swans," said ballet spokesman Jim Fletcher.  The dancers have six weeks to lose their tans before the company's first winter-season performance. Fletcher said makeup can be used, but added that some of the dancers were "scarlet" and difficult to disguise.  "I'm just a little worried that the lighting effects for this 'Swan Lake' will wreak havoc with sunburned dancers, making them look purple and puce," said artistic director Derek Deane.  "The last time we had a heat wave like this we ended up with a scarlet Wilis in 'Giselle.' We simply can't give roasted swans to the public this season," Deane said. ]]></newspaper:text>

	<newspaper:text xml:space='preserve'><![CDATA[(Stanford University) The Section on Medical Informatics held one of its two annual week-long courses this past week, starting on Monday August 18.  Larry Fagan, the genial scientist who manages the course was quite pleased with both the attendance (60 people, from over 20 organizations, attended) and the content. "It's amazing-- we covered a lot of ground for a lot of people. At first I wondered if we were being a little bit ambitious," he said. "But, in retrospect, the program was a stunning success. If any of your readers want to attend one of next year's courses, tell them they can contact me via e-mail at fagan@smi.stanford.edu".]]></newspaper:text>

	<newspaper:text xml:space='preserve'><![CDATA[(Stanford University) Recently, DARPA, the DOD research and funding agency, has formed the High-Performance Knowledge-Base initiative (the HPKB program) to support military needs for intelligent software in a wide variety of different situations. The needs range from logistics and planning through battlefield awareness and on to crisis management. It's clear-- The information explosion has hit the DOD with a vengeance and there's really only one solution: use cutting edge AI techniques to cope with the overload and make better decisions faster. "We're very excited about the new HPKB program," said faculty member Mark Musen. "We've been developing all these great new technologies-- knowledge acquisition tools, problem-solving methods, networked information transport mechanisms-- and now it's all coming together. This is a large scale test of the things we've been working towards and we're thrilled to be on board."]]></newspaper:text>
