<p>The Slots tab provides a single window in which you may view, create, and
edit <b>slots</b>. Although slots are often thought of as being attached to a
class, they can be defined and manipulated independently, and can exist without
any relationship to classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p> An example of the Slots tab is shown below. The window consists of three
panes:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>The Slots pane in the upper left shows all the slots in the project and allows you to
    edit existing slots, create new slots, view back-references for slots, and delete
    slots. For more information, see the <a href="slot_buttons.html">Slot
    Buttons</a>.</li>
  <li>The Classes Pane at the Slots Tab in the lower left shows the all the
    classes that have the slot attached. This is a view-only window. To view or
    manipulate classes, use the <a href="../classes/classes_tab.html">Classes Tab</a>. As mentioned above, a slot can exist
    without being attached to any class.&nbsp;<br>
    Note: If you cannot see the Classes Pane, your window may be too small. You
    can see the pane by enlarging your window or by dragging the slider bar at
    the bottom of the <a href="slot_menu.html">Slot Menu</a>. See <a href="file:///C:/SMI/doc/users_guide/projects/small_window.html">Working
    With a Small Window</a> for more information.</li>
  <li>When a single slot is selected, the Edit pane on the right contains the <a href="slot_form.html">Slot
    Form</a>
    for the selected slot. The <a href="slot_form.html">Slot Form</a> allows you to: name the
    slot,
    choose its cardinality and value type, define constraints, defaults, and
    maximum and minimum values, as well as provide a brief description. The <a href="slot_form.html">Slot Form</a>
    can be displayed as a
    separate window by clicking the View <img border="0" src="../classes/images/View.gif" width="12" height="16">  
    slot button in the Slots Pane.&nbsp;The <a href="slot_form.html">Slot Form</a>
    can also be accessed from the <a href="../classes/template_slot_pane.html">Templates
    Slots pane</a> in the <a href="../classes/classes_tab.html">Classes Tab</a>.</li>
</ol>
