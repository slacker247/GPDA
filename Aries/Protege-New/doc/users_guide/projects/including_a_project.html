<p>You can include an existing project in your current Protégé-2000 project.
This allows you to build a single large project from one or more smaller
projects. Included classes, slots, and instances cannot be edited; included
forms can be edited, however.</p>

<p>To include a project into an existing Protégé-2000 project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select <b>Include...</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu.</li>
  <li>In the Project dialog box, browse to the location of the project you want
    to include.</li>
  <li>Select the .pprj file of the desired project.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Open</b>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The project is imported into your current project. To show they cannot be
edited, frames in the included project appear with pale icons: for example, <img border="0" src="images/ReadOnlyClass.gif" width="15" height="16">,
<img border="0" src="images/ReadonlyInstance.gif" width="15" height="15">, <img border="0" src="images/ReadonlyDirectSlot.gif" width="15" height="16">.</p>
<p>Once a project has been included in another project, there is no way to
remove it using the Protégé-2000 interface. It is possible to remove an
included project by editing the &quot;Project&quot; instance in the <b>pprj</b>
file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see a list of all imported projects by selecting <b>Show Included
Projects...</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu.</p>
