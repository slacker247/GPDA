<a NAME="WhatIsADiagram"></a><b><font size="+3">1. What is a Diagram</font></b>
<p>Most user interaction with the Protege GUI is done via forms. Each class
has a form associated to it, and each instance is simply a filled out form.
For example, the <a href="editor_in_ontology.gif">Editor</a> class has
an <a href="editor_in_forms_layout.gif">associated form</a>, and instances
of Editor are displayed as <a href="acquiring_an_editor.gif">filled-out
forms</a>. This approach facilitates structured data entry for instances.
More generally,&nbsp; it simplifies local interaction with the knowledge
base (e.g., looking at and editing small number of instances in great detail).
Often, however, users want to be able to view a large number of instances
at once, along with selected relationships among the instances.
<p>Diagrams are one way to accomplish this latter goal. A diagram is, visually,
a set of nodes and connectors (also known as &quot;links&quot; or &quot;wires&quot;) that join
the nodes. Underlying these are instances of classes. Nodes map to domain
objects and connectors map to instances of Connector-- a class the diagram
widget uses to represent important relationships. When the user sees a
diagram, they see a high-level summary of a large number of instances,
without seeing a lot of the details of any particular instance. For example,
in <a href="step9.gif">this diagram </a>(which we'll discuss in detail
later), 8 nodes, which are instances of 3 distinct classes (represented
by distinct shapes and colors), are displayed. In addition, 7 connectors,
visually representing the &quot;supervises&quot; relationship are displayed. While
the user cannot, for example, immediately determine the social security
number of Mr. Science, she does immediately see Mr. Science's place in
the organization chart (and, if she is a domain expert, can probably immediately
intuit his roles and responsibilities within the organization).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="WalkingThroughAnExample"></a><b><font size="+3">2. Walking Through
an Example</font></b>
<p>To make this more concrete, we're going to walk through an example,
adding the ability to use the diagram widget to an existing project. In
this case, we will be adapting the newspaper project.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size="+1">Step 1:&nbsp; Load the existing project and decide
what you will represent using diagrams</font></b>
<p>We will use <a href="step1.gif">the newspaper project</a>. We will use
the diagram widget to visually represent the chain of command in the newsroom
(e.g., we will create an organization chart).
<p><b><font size="+1">Step 2: Make sure the diagram project is included</font></b>
<p>The next step is to make sure that the project being modified includes
the diagrams project (the diagrams&nbsp; project contains a few key concept
definitions the diagram widget requires). The diagram project is included
in your Protege-2000 distribution, as part of the examples directory. To
see if the diagrams project is already included, you can use the <i>Project</i>
menu and choose the <a href="step2.gif"><i>Show Included Project</i>s</a>
option. If the diagram project is not included,&nbsp; you can include it
by using the <i>Include...
</i>option on the <i>Project</i> menu.
<p><b><font size="+1">Step 3: Find the class you want to use in conjunction
with the diagram widget</font></b>
<p>Our goal is to represent the managerial hierarchy (who reports to whom)&nbsp;
visually&nbsp; in an organization chart. The newspaper project already
contains a class, <i><a href="step3.gif">Organization</a></i>, which contains
this information. So we will start by modifying <i>Organization</i>, to
bring it in line with what the diagram widget requires.
<p><b><font size="+1">Step 4: Make the diagram class from step 3 a subclass
of <i>Network</i> and an instance of <i>Network_Metaclass</i></font></b>
<p>We need to alter <i>Organization</i> in two ways: we need to make it
a subclass of <i>Network</i> and we need to make it an instance of <i>Network_Metaclass</i>.
Both <i>Network</i> and <i>Network_Metaclass</i> are defined in the diagrams
project we included as part of step 2. Making <i>Organization</i> a subclass
of <i>Network</i>, causes 5 template slots to be attached to <i>Organization</i>.
These slots will be used by the diagram widget to record information about
the visual representation of the diagram (e.g., object locations and connectivity
relationships). Making <i>Organization</i> an instance of <i>Network_Metaclass</i>
attaches the slot <i>node_slot</i> to <i>Organization</i> as an own slot.
We will use <i>node_slot </i>to tell the diagram widget a little bit more
about the structure of our intended diagram.
<p>At the end of this step, <i>Organization</i> looks like <a href="step4.gif">this</a>.
<p><b><font size="+1">Step 5: Choose the nodes slot</font></b>
<p>Once we've finished altering the definition of <i>Organization</i>,
we still need to set a value for <i>node_slo</i>t. The motivation for using
<i>node_slot</i>
is this: knowledge-bases should be structured, as much as possible, in
ways that make sense to domain experts, based on their experience in the
domain. In particular, choosing to use a diagram widget shouldn't alter
the knowledge-base structure (in step 4, this precept is violated. But
only a little bit, and only by adding slots to classes).
<p>This rule leads to a problem: the diagram widget needs to know where
to store the instances corresponding to the nodes in the diagram. Since
the instances corresponding to nodes are often instances of important domain
concepts, there is usually already a slot that points to them (unlike Connectors.
The <i>connectors </i>slot attached to <i>Organization</i> probably isn't
redundant with an existing slot). In our example, Organization already
has a slot called <i>employees</i>, which points to all the employees in
the Organization.
<p>What we need to do is find a way to tell the diagram widget &quot;store the
instances corresponding to the nodes in the diagram in <i>this slot</i>.&quot;
We do this by storing a slot reference in&nbsp; <i>node_slot</i> does--
the diagram widget stores all the instances corresponding to nodes in a
slot, which is the value of&nbsp; <i>node_slot.</i>
<p>The value of <i>node_slot</i> must meet three criteria: it must be attached
to must be attached to <i>Organization</i> as a template slot it must be
multiple-valued, and it must be of type Instance. The value of<i> node_slot</i>
is the slot is used by the diagram widget to store the instances which
are displayed in the diagram as nodes.
<p>In our example, <a href="step5.gif">we use the <i>employees</i> slot
as the value of <i>node_slot</i></a>.
<p><b><font size="+1">Step 6: Create connectors</font></b>
<p>Connectors are classes whose instances store information about a link
in a diagram. A definition of a connector&nbsp; records two distinct types
of information: which types of objects can be connected by this link and
which (if any) slots on the objects to fill out. In our example, there
is a single type of connector, <i><a href="step6.gif">Supervises</a></i>.
As with all connectors, Supervises is a subclass of <i>Connector</i> and
an instance of <i>Connector_Metaclass</i>. An instance of <i>Supervisor</i>
can connect an instance of <i>Editor</i> to an instance of <i>Employee</i>.
And, when it does so, the <i>supervises</i> slot on the instance of <i>Editor</i>
will point to the instance of <i>Employee</i>.
<p>Defining the connectors is the last step which involves modifying the
ontology. The remaining steps all involve either configuring the diagram
widget or acquiring instances.
<p><b><font size="+1">Step 7:&nbsp; Choose which slots to display and select
the diagram widget:</font></b>
<p>The first step in configuring the diagram class&nbsp; is probably to
hide the slots it inherited from <i>Network</i>. These slots are automatically
filled out by the diagram widget and contain information that, while important
to the structure of the knowledge-base, are slots the user probably won't
want to see.
<br>In our example, we hide all of the inherited slots: <i>connectors</i>,<i>
last_divider_location</i>, <i>main_panel_height</i>, <i>main_panel_width</i>,
and <i>layout_information</i>.
<p>After doing this, <a href="step7.gif">we must still choose to use the
diagram widget for the <i>employees</i> slot</a>.
<p><b><font size="+1">Step 8: Configure the diagram widget</font></b>
<p>Double-clicking on the diagrams widget brings up a panel with an extensive
number of configuration options. These options allow the diagram widget
to display different types of information (e.g., different node classes)
in different ways. In <a href="step8.gif">our example</a>, our node types
(<i>Editor</i>, <i>Columnist</i>, <i>Reporter</i>, and <i>Salesperson</i>)
all have distinct visual representations.
<p><b><font size="+1">Step 9: Acquire instances</font></b>
<p>Finally, after all this hard work, knowledge-acquisition can actually
take place. <a href="step9.gif">Here</a> is a screenshot of the diagram
widget in action.
<p><b><font size="+1">Step 10: Send feedback to the Protege group</font></b>
<p>The diagram widget is one of the more complex, and cumbersome, widgets
that ships with Protege. As you use it, you will undoubtedly notice many
shortcomings. We'd like to hear about them. The appropriate venue for comments
and discussions is the <a href="mailto:protege-discussion@smi.stanford.edu">protege-discussion</a>
mailing list.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="TheDiagramOntology"></a><b><font size="+3">3. The Diagram Knowledge
Base</font></b>
<p>The diagrams knowledge base is a small knowledge base which must be
included in any project which will use the diagram widget. The diagrams
knowledge base contains the following 7 classes:
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<center><table BORDER WIDTH="80%">
<tr>
<td><b>Class Name</b></td>

<td><b>What it Really Represents</b></td>

<td><b>Role in Diagrams Knowledge Base</b></td>

<td><b>Role during Ontology Design&nbsp;</b></td>

<td><b>Role during Knowledge Acquisition</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>DiagramEntity</td>

<td>Nothing. DiagramEntity&nbsp; has no conceptual content at all.&nbsp;</td>

<td>DiagramEntity is only used to help organize the diagrams knowledge
base ontology-- all other classes in the diagrams knowledge base are subclasses
of DiagramEntity.&nbsp;</td>

<td>None.</td>

<td>None.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Network</td>

<td>Subclasses of&nbsp; Network are&nbsp; classes which have some content
which can be visualized as a diagram. That is, there is a slot attached
to the subclass whose values can be viewed using the diagram widget.&nbsp;</td>

<td>Network is&nbsp; an abstract superclass of any class whose form will
use the diagram widget. It defines 5 slots (<i>connectors</i>, <i>last_divider_location</i>,
<i>layout_information</i>,
<i>main_panel_height</i>,
and <i>main_panel_width</i>) which the diagram widget will use to store
information.&nbsp;</td>

<td>Domain classes which will use the diagram widget must be subclasses
of Network That is, subclasses of Network are usually domain classes that
have been (slightly) altered so that the diagram widget will work. Subclasses
of Network&nbsp; must also be instances of Network_Metaclass in order for
the diagram widget to function properly.&nbsp;</td>

<td>Instances of Network, or its subclasses,&nbsp; will be acquired from
the user.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Network_Metaclass</td>

<td>None.&nbsp;</td>

<td>Network_Metaclass is used to attach a single own slot, <i>node_slot</i>,&nbsp;
to subclasses of Network.&nbsp;</td>

<td>Subclasses of Network should be instances of Network_Metaclass (rather
than :STANDARD-CLASS). <i>node_slot</i>, which will be an own slot on the
subclass of Network, must have its value set to a slot which is attached
to the subclass of Network being configured.&nbsp;</td>

<td>The value of <i>node_slot</i> is used by the diagram widget. From the
usr's point of view, once the ontology is defined, Network_Metaclass can
be ignored.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Connector</td>

<td>Subclasses of Connector are classes whose instances are visually represented,
in a diagram, as a wire. Subclasses of Connector are reified slot-value
bindings.&nbsp;</td>

<td>Connector is an abstract superclass which has two slots: <i>first_object</i>
and <i>second_object</i>.&nbsp;</td>

<td>Subclasses of Connector are often not part of the conceptualization
of a domain, but instead are explicitly added to the knowledge base in
order to visually represent knowledge (<a href="index.html#Debate">*</a>).&nbsp;
Subclasses of Connector must also be instances of Connector_Metaclass in
order for the diagram widget to function properly.</td>

<td>Instances of Connector, or its subclasses, are usually generated automatically
by the diagram widget, and stored in the <i>connectors</i> slot on an instance
of Network.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Connector_Metaclass</td>

<td>None.&nbsp;</td>

<td>Connector_Metaclass is used to attach a pair of own slots, <i>first_object_slot_pointer</i>
and <i>second_object_slot_pointer</i>,&nbsp; to subclasses of Connector.&nbsp;</td>

<td>Subclasses of Connector should be instances of&nbsp;
<br>Connector_Metaclass (rather than :STANDARD-CLASS). <i>first_object_slot_pointer</i>
and <i>second_object_slot_pointer</i>
<br>don't have to have values. But if a value is set, it should be to a
slot which is attached to the appropriate object (e.g., the value of <i>first_object_slot_pointer</i>
should be a slot which is actually attached to any object which can be
stored in the slot <i>first_object</i>).&nbsp;</td>

<td>If one of the own slots on a subclass of connector has a value, the
diagram widget will attempt to fill in the slot. For example: if <i>first_object_slot_pointer</i>
has, as value, the slot <i>foo</i>, then when both the first_object and
second_object slots on an instance of the subclass are filled in (e.g.,
visually when the wire is &quot;connected&quot; at both ends), the diagram widget
will fill in the slot <i>foo</i> on the value of <i>first_object </i>with
the value of <i>second_object</i>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>ObjectLocation</td>

<td>An instance of ObjectLocation records the location of an object. The
Location is stored as a Rectangle, the object could be any frame.</td>

<td>Used to record visual information. Objects in a diagram have locations
that must be stored (so that if a knowledge base is closed and opened later,
the diagram will look the same). ObjectLocation has two slots: <i>location</i>
and <i>object</i>.</td>

<td>None. There is no reason to make any changes to this class, or to create
subclasses of it. This class could be entirely hidden during knowledge
acquisition.</td>

<td>Instances of ObjectLocation are&nbsp; generated automatically by the
diagram widget, and stored in the <i>layout_information</i> slot on an
instance of Network.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Rectangle</td>

<td>&nbsp;</td>

<td></td>

<td>None. There is no reason to make any changes to this class, or to create
subclasses of it. This class could be entirely hidden during knowledge
acquisition.</td>

<td>Instances of Rectangle are&nbsp; generated automatically by the diagram
widget, and stored in the <i>location</i> slot on an instance of ObjectLocation.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Point</td>

<td></td>

<td></td>

<td>None. There is no reason to make any changes to this class, or to create
subclasses of it. This class could be entirely hidden during knowledge
acquisition.</td>

<td>Instances of Point are&nbsp; generated automatically by the diagram
widget, and stored in the <i>upper_left_corner</i> and l<i>ower_right_corner</i>
slots on an instance of Rectangle.</td>
</tr>

<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Debate"></a>(*) Although there is some debate about this point.
As one prominent user of diagrams has stated, &quot;Connector classes represent
reified relations, and as such, they should be part of the conceptualization
of a domain. It's true that are structured according to the specification
of Connector class/metaclass so that they can be visualized, but I think
it's better to encourage people to see them as playing a role in the conceptualization
of the domain.&quot;
