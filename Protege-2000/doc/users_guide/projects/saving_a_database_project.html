Saving a Database Project<br>
<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>
<p>You can save a Protégé-2000 project as a single table in a JDBC database.
Before you do this, you will need to do the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>make sure you have a database program installed on your system</li>
  <li>make sure you have a JDBC driver that is compatible with your database and
    the version of the Java VM that you are using</li>
  <li>add the driver to Protégé's path by placing the jar file of the driver
    in the plugins subdirectory of the Protege-2000 directory.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note:</b> When a project is saved in a JDBC database, backend changes to
the database (for example, changes to slots, classes, and instances) are
committed as soon as they are made. However, changes to the User Interface
(which is stored in the .pprj file) are not committed until you press the Save
button.</p>
<p>Once you have set up your JDBC database, you can save your Protégé-2000 project as
a database files in one of two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the project is first created, by selecting <b>JDBC Database</b> in
    the Select Format dialog box.</li>
  <li>By selecting <b>Save in Format...</b> from the <b>Project</b> menu and
    then selecting <b>JDBC Database</b> in the Select Format dialog box.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have chosen your format, choose the name and location for the
project as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>When you have selected <b>JDBC Database</b>, the Single Table JDBC Database dialog box is displayed:<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/SaveDatabase.gif" width="468" height="392"></li>
  <li>To select or change the name or location of the <b>pprj</b> file, enter
    the information you want in the <b>Project</b> line of the dialog box. Be sure to give
    the file a <b>pprj</b> 
    extension. To browse for a new location, cllick the <img border="0" src="images/Add.gif" width="19" height="19">
    button.&nbsp; If you do not
    specify a location for the project, by default, the project is saved in the
    directory where Protégé-2000 is installed.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Enter the name of your JDBC driver in the <b>JDBC Driver</b> line of the
    dialog box.</li>
  <li>Enter the URL for your database in the <b>JDBC URL</b> line.</li>
  <li>Protégé-2000 will automatically use the name of the existing <b>pprj</b>
    file as the name of the table in the database. If you wish to change this,
    type the new name for the database in the Table line of the dialog
    box.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>If your database requires a username and/or password, enter these in the
    appropriate lines of the dialog box.</li>
  <li>Click OK.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>You can store multiple projects in the same database by giving their tables
different names.</p>
