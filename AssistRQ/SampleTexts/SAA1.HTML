<P>On 08 January, 2002 a default, unpatched installation of Solaris8 Sparc was 
remotely compromised with the </FONT><A

interesting is that this is the first time the attack was identified and

  <LI>What is a NOP slide, and how is this one different from the NOP slide in

  href="http://project.honeynet.org/scans/scan10/scan10.txt"><FONT face=Arial 
  size=2>Scan10</FONT></A><FONT face=Arial size=2>? <BR><BR>A NOP slide is a 
  technique used in buffer overflow exploit code to pad the buffer when the 
  exact end of the buffer is not known or it is <span GateID="3968" title="NegateHedge" style="background:Green;">not</span> obvious where code execution 
  <span GateID="3955" title="Hedge" style="background:Red;">might</span> begin. Then if the exploit can set the instruction pointer to point to 
  any memory location within the NOP instruction padding, the CPU will "slide" 
  into the executable code.<BR><BR>The rpc.statd exploit in Scan 10 was for a 
  Linux OS on an x86 system. For the x86 architecture, the NOP code is 1 byte 
  with the value 0x90. The dtspcd attack was on a Solaris Sparc system, and the 
  NOP code for the Sparc architecture is 4 bytes long with the value 
  0x801c4011.<BR><BR>
  <LI>The attack was on 08 Jan, 2002. Would Snort have generated an alert then 
  for the attack? <BR><BR>It depends. The version of Snort available on <span GateID="3946" title="Day" style="background:lightBlue;"><span GateID="3961" title="Day" style="background:Magenta;">1/8</span></span>/02 
  was 1.8.3. The default set of rules that came with 1.8.3 did include a 
  signature for detecting an attempt to execute shellcode on a Sparc system that 
  could have detected this attack. It wouldn’t have specifically identified the 
  attack as the dtspcd exploit, though. However, the shellcode rules file was 
  commented out in the default snort.conf file, so unless it was uncommented, 
  Snort would not have detected the attack at all.<BR><BR>
  <LI>In the exploit code, the command "/bin/sh sh -i" is given, what is its 
  purpose, and why is 'sh' shown twice? <BR><BR>At this point in the attack the 
  attacker is creating an inetd configuration file in /tmp/x to create a root 
  command shell whenever a client connects to port 1524 on the compromised 
  system. From the inetd.conf man page, the syntax for an inetd configuration 
  file entry is:<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>service-name

  server-arguments<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>where</FONT><FONT 
  face="Courier New" size=2><BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial 
  size=2>server-program is the pathname of the server program to be invoked by 
  inetd, and<BR>server-arguments is defined as the entire command line 
  (including argument 0).</FONT><FONT face="Courier New" 
  size=2><BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>In this case, "/bin/sh" was the 
  server-program and "sh -i" were the server arguments, where "sh" is argument 
  0.<BR><BR>
  <LI>The attacker executed a variety of commands on the hacked Solaris box. 
  Which commands were automated by the exploit, which commands were manual by 
  the attacker himself? <BR><BR>Based on the times at which the commands were 
  executed and the way that many were combined on a single line, I’d speculate 
  the breakdown is as follows:<BR><BR><U>Exploit</U><BR>

  though, so I can’t say definitively how it works. If I were to hazard a guess, 
  I’d say that it has a hardcoded password in it that if supplied gives a root 
  shell. If the password is not supplied, it <span GateID="3957" title="Hedge" style="background:lightBlue;">probably</span> then calls the original

<P>What is the purpose of this command and what does 'BD' stand for? 
</P></FONT><FONT face=Arial></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P>The first thing the attack program did after successfully exploiting the 
dtspcd server was create a listening process on port 1524 which would create a 
root shell upon a network connection from a remote client. The way it did this 
was by creating an inetd configuration file, /tmp/x, with the following 
entry:<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>ingreslock stream tcp 
nowait root /bin/sh sh –I<BR></P></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P>It then created the listening process by running inetd with /tmp/x as its 
input file:</P></FONT><FONT face="Courier New" size=2>
<P>/usr/sbin/inetd –s /tmp/x</P></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>
<P>So, the "echo" command above will display the PID of the inetd process 
associated with the root command shell back door if it was successfully 
installed. And, hence, my guess is that BD stands for Back 
Door.</P></FONT></BODY></HTML>
