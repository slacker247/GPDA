	from the NOP slide in the <tt class="APPLICATION">rpc.statd</tt>
	exploit in Scan 10?</font><p>A "NOP sled", as it is more commonly known, is a series
	of no-operation instructions in the machine code of the target
	architecture.  This series is often used as part of a buffer
	overflow technique, where the return address in the call stack
	is modified to point to exploit code.  By using a NOP sled,
	the precise address of the exploit code need not be known &#8212;
	instead, an address in the middle of the NOPs is chosed, causing
	execution to <i class="EMPHASIS">slide</i> into the exploit
	code.</p><p>In Scan 10, a standard 0x90 NOP sled was used as part of
	a format string attack for the x86 architecture.
	Scan 20 uses one of the many possible NOP instructions
	available on the Sparc architecture, in this 0x801c4011.</p></div><div class="SECT2"><h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN378">Q2 Answer</a></h2><font color="RED">The attack was on 08 Jan, 2002.  Would Snort have

	sid-645 (NOP sled 0x801c4011 for the sparc architecture) in
	<tt class="FILENAME">shellcode.rules</tt> since that
	file was added to the <tt class="APPLICATION">snort</tt> CVS repository,

	in the exploit code is actually part of an
	<tt class="APPLICATION">inetd</tt> configuration file.  An excerpt from the manual page for
	<tt class="FILENAME">inetd.conf</tt> explains the two fields used

	</p><p>In plain English, the initial <b class="COMMAND">/bin/sh</b>
	indicates the actual name of the application which
	<tt class="APPLICATION">inetd</tt> starts up when receiving a connection
	on the port named in the configuration.  The
	"sh -i" portion is the argument list passed to the
	application.  What is tricky, and explains why
	"sh" is shown twice, is that the C libraries
	define the argument array (<tt class="VARNAME">argv[]</tt>)
	to include the actual name of the application
	at position 0.  In this case, the second "sh"
	is just the value at position 0 in the
	<tt class="VARNAME">argv[]</tt> array.</p><p>It's useful to know that some programs
	look at the value of <tt class="VARNAME">argv[0]</tt>
	to determine how they were invoked, and change
	their behaviour accordingly.  <tt class="APPLICATION">Gzip</tt>
	is a great example of this; <tt class="APPLICATION">gunzip</tt>
	is hard linked to the same executable, and the program

	of the answers within 90 minutes.  We found that writing
	up our thoughts formally took a great deal of time, and
	encouraged us pursue further research for completeness.
	In the end,
	this challenge took us about 30 hours, of which over half
	was spent writing this document, and the remainder was
	spent getting more detailed analysis on the questions.</p></div><div class="SECT2"><h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN552">Bonus Question Answer</a></h2><font color="RED">One of the commands executed during
	    the attack is:
<b class="COMMAND">echo "BD PID(s): "`ps -fed|grep ' -s /tmp/x'|grep -v grep|awk '{print $2}'`</b>
	    What is the purpose of this command and what does
	    'BD' stand for?</font><p>To understand the purpose, the first step is
	to decode the embedded pipeline (contained between
	the backticks).  What this pipeline does is get a
	process listing of all running programs, using
	<tt class="APPLICATION">ps</tt>.  The listing is then
	<tt class="APPLICATION">grep</tt>'d  for all occurences of the string " -s /tmp/x"
	(the leading space is important to avoid the appearance
	of trying to pass the <tt class="OPTION">-s</tt> option to <tt class="APPLICATION">grep</tt>).
	That string was seen before, in the initial exploit
	as part of the commandline for launching <tt class="APPLICATION">inetd</tt>,
	so the first two parts of the pipeline must be
	intending to capture all <tt class="APPLICATION">inetd</tt> processes using
	<tt class="FILENAME">/tmp/x</tt> as their configuration file.
	The third part of the pipeline removes the <tt class="APPLICATION">grep</tt>
	process which also happens to have the same string
	in its arguments (from the second stage of the pipeline).
	And finally, the last part prints the process ID number
	of the found <tt class="APPLICATION">inetd</tt> process(es).</p><p>So, the purpose of the command is to locate all
	the running <tt class="APPLICATION">inetd</tt> backdoors (the acronym "BD" is for
	"back door"), and list their PIDs.
