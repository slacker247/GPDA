Congratulations on downloading a binary distribution of Jess. You'll
see a file "jess.jar" in this directory -- that's Jess. To get a Jess
command prompt, type

   java -classpath jess.jar jess.Main

Start by having a look at the manual. Open docs/index.html in your
favorit web browser.

The directory "examples" contains some tiny example scripts written in
the Jess rule language. The directory jess/examples/ contains several
more simple programs written in Java. The Jess manual includes instructions
on using these samples.
