 Understanding Inverse Slots<br>

<p>The <b>Inverse Slot</b> widget in the <a href="slot_form.html">The Slot Form</a>
allows you to create a reciprocal relationships between two slots, so that as
one slot is filled in at one instance, its inverse slot is automatically filled
in at another instance, according to the relationship you specified.</p>
<p>This section gives an overview of how to analyze a project and design inverse
slots. For information on how to use the user interface, see&nbsp;<a href="make_inverse_slot.html">Creating an Inverse Slot Relationship</a>.</p>
<p>For example, suppose you want to keep track of which editor(s) edit which
section(s). There is already a slot <b>sections </b>at the class <b>Editor</b>
which takes as values instances in the class <b>Section</b>. You could create an
inverse slot <b>editor</b> at the class <b>Section</b> which takes as values
instances in the class <b>Editor</b>. Now, at the instance <b>Mr. Science</b>
you assign the value <b>Science</b> to the slot <b>sections</b>. Then, at the
instance <b>Science</b>, <b>Mr. Science</b> automatically appears as a value for
the slot <b>editor</b>.</p>
<p>This section considers the most common relationship, an inverse slot
relationship between two instances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To design and create inverse slots:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First identify the inverse relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Second, analyze the Protégé components of the relationship.</li>
  <li>Finally create or assign the slots to the appropriate classes and create
    the inverse slot relationship between them.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Identify the Relationship</h2>
<p>This is a reciprocal relationship that always occurs: for example, if Mr.
Science edits the Science section, the Science section is edited by Mr. Science.
Different types of inverse relationships are possible. Take the following
criteria into consideration:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>You can restrict the relationship to a one-to-one correspondence <i>OR</i>
    you can allow one or both of the slots to have multiple values. For example,
    Chief Honcho edits a number of sections.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The relationship can be between instances in different classes <i>OR</i>
    instances in the same class. For example, <i>likes</i> and <i>is_liked_by</i>
    would be a relationship where the slot and its inverse slot are both
    attached to <b>Person</b>.</li>
  <li>A slot can be its own inverse. <i>shares_ an_ office_ with </i>would be a
    candidate for an inverse relationship where the inverse slot was identical
    with the original slot. This is a stronger tie than simply having instances
    in the same class.</li>
  <li>The relationship must be reciprocal.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Analyze the Relationship in Protégé</h2>
<p>Once you have identified the relationship in your ontology, you need to
analyze it in terms of your Protégé project. For an inverse slot relationship
between Instance slots, determine the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What Protégé class(es) do you want for the first set of instances? Make
    sure to choose a class or classes that are appropriate for the project. It
    is most important to choose a class list that is not too small; that is, you
    need to select a list of classes such that every possible instance is in one
    of those classes. At the same time, for simplicity you want the class list
    to be focused on the instances and not be too broad.&nbsp;<br>
    For example, in the <b>newspaper</b> project, one of the reporters, Larry
    Tennis-Nut, is an eager beaver and sometimes edits the Sports section. It
    would make sense to expand the list of classes to <b>Editor</b> and <b>Reporter</b>.
    However, no salesmen or columnists are allowed to edit a section. Therefore,
    while it would be possible to simply use the class <b>Employee</b>, it is
    cleaner not to.<br>
    Call this first list of classes <b>Class_List_A</b>. It may well be a single
    class.</li>
  <li>If the second set of instances is different from the first, perform the
    same analysis for the second set of instances. Here, we will restrict
    ourselves to instances in the class <b>Section</b>.<br>
    Call this second list of classes <b>Class_List_B</b>. It may well be a
    single class. It might also be identical to <b>Class_List_A.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on this information, here is what you need to do in your Protégé
project:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a slot of type Instance which takes values in <b>Class_List_A</b>.
    We'll call this <i>original_slot</i>.</li>
  <li>Create another slot of type Instance which takes values in <b>Class_List_B</b>.
    We'll call this <i>inverse_slot</i>.<br>
    If the information is important in your ontology, it is likely that one or
    both of these slots already exist in the project.</li>
  <li>Assign your Protégé slots to the appropriate classes. First, assign <i>original_slot</i>
    to every class in <b>Class_List_B</b>.&nbsp;<br>
    Recall that the target values of <i>original_slot</i> are in <b>Class_List_A</b>.
    Assigning the slot to <b>Class_List_B</b> is what creates the
    cross-connection between the classes.</li>
  <li>Similarly, assign <i>inverse_slot</i> to every class in <b>Class_List_A</b>.</li>
  <li>Make <i>inverse_slot</i> the inverse of <i>original_slot</i>. You can
    actually do this as soon as both slots are created.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that if you create an inverse slot relationship after some instances
have been created, existing instances will not display the inverse slot
information.</p>
