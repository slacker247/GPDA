<p>The Forms pane at the left of the <a href="forms_tab.html">Forms Tab</a>
displays all the classes in your project. The Forms Pane has three components:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <a href="forms_pane.html#Forms Window"> Forms Window</a> displays the hierarchy of the classes in your
    project. Icons give more information about the form associated with the
    class. You cannot change the hierarchy in this window. To edit the
    hierarchy, use the <a href="../classes/classes_tab.html">Classes Tab</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="form_buttons.html"> Form Buttons</a> at the top right of the pane allow you to clear all
    customizations from your form as well as to create a form with a preset
    layout.</li>
  <li>The Forms Lookup Bar allows you to locate a form in the Forms
    Window by typing all or part of the name and clicking the
    binoculars.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h2 align="left"><a name="Forms Window"></a>The Forms Window</h2>

<p align="left">This displays all the forms in the project, by the name of their
associated class. When a single form is selected in this window, its associated form is displayed in the Form
Edit pane to the right. Every class, concrete or abstract, has an associated
form. For a concrete class, a user defines an instance of the class by filling
out the class's form. For an abstract class, the form is only used to define
layout information which can then be inherited by other classes. If you have not created or modified the form, Protégé-2000 uses
    a default layout based on the slot type and cardinality.</p>

<p>As usual, icons to the left of the name give information about the display of
the hierarchy:</p>

<div align="left">
  <table border="0" width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td width="11%"> <img border="0" src="../classes/images/Hierarchy_open.gif" width="12" height="17">
      </td>
      <td width="89%">This icon
indicates that all subclasses of the class are displayed. In some views, this is shown as a -.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="11%"><img border="0" src="../classes/images/Hierarchy_closed.gif" width="16" height="12"> </td>
      <td width="89%">This
icon indicates that the class has subclasses which are not currently displayed. In some views, this is shown as a +.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="11%"><b>No icon</b></td>
      <td width="89%">The absence of a <img border="0" src="../classes/images/Hierarchy_open.gif" width="12" height="17">
or a <img border="0" src="../classes/images/Hierarchy_closed.gif" width="16" height="12"> indicates that the
class has no subclasses.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p align="left">The following icon to the right of a class form gives information
about the form associated with the class:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="11%"><img border="0" src="images/CustomizedForm.gif" width="11" height="16"></td>
    <td width="89%">
      <p>The form has been customized. You can customize
      a form by altering its widgets, for example: moving or resizing a widget,
      changing a widget's label, or selecting which buttons appear for the
      widget. See <a href="modifying_controls_appearance.html">Modifying a
      Widget's Appearance</a> for more information.</p>
      <p>You can clear all customizations for the selected form by
      clicking the Remove Customizations <img border="0" src="images/RemoveCustomizations.gif" width="16" height="15">
      Form Button at the top right of the Forms Window. This will return
      the form to the default layout based on slot type and cardinality.</p>
