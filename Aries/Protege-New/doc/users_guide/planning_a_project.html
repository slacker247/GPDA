<p>The development of a successful knowledge-based system built with Protégé-2000 is
more of an art than a science. Nonetheless, we can suggest a standard pattern of use that
new users should follow to avoid some possible problems of systems development.
Protégé-2000 is designed to support <em>iterative development</em>, where there are
cycles of revision to the ontologies and other components of the knowledge-based system.
Therefore developers should not expect to &quot;complete&quot; ontology development
without considering other aspects of the process.</p>

<p>For the development of a successful Protégé-2000 project, we would recommend the
following steps: 

<ol>
  <li>Plan for the application and expected uses of the knowledge base. This usually means
    working with domain experts that have a set of problems that could be solved with
    knowledge-base technology.</li>
  <li>Build an initial small ontology of classes and slots, as explained in the <font size="3"><a href="classes/index.html" target="main">Classes
    and Slots</a></font> strand.</li>
  <li>When you have built this ontology (and later when you have extended it or opened it from
    file), you can directly view forms for entering&nbsp; instance knowledge into the
    ontology, because Protégé-2000 generates initial forms &quot;on the fly&quot;, in its
    role as a KA-tool generator.</li>
  <li>You use these forms for acquiring slot values of your test instances, as explained in
    the<font size="3">  <a href="instances/index.html" target="main">Instances</a></font>
    strand. At this point, it is usually appropriate to show the
    ontology and the filled-out instance forms to the domain experts or your expected users.
    This inevitably leads to a set of revisions, both to the ontology (2.) and to the forms
    (5.). Note that ontology modifications can be expensive, since some sorts of change could
    force rebuilding some or all of the knowledge base.</li>
  <li>Customize the forms to a refined knowledge-acquisition tool, as explained in the
    <a href="forms/understanding_forms.html" target="main">Forms</a> strand.
    While constructing this customized version of the KA-subtool, further design problems in
    the original ontology may become apparent. If necessary revise the ontology and repeat at
    4.</li>
  <li>With your domain experts, build a somewhat larger knowledge-base that can be tested with
    your application or problem-solving method.</li>
  <li>Test the full application with your end-users. This step can lead to further revisions
    to the ontology and the KA-subtool.</li>
</ol>

<p>The picture below shows this typical pattern of use for the Protégé-2000 subsystems.
The black arrows indicate the forward progression through the process, while the blue
dotted arrows show places where revisions are usually necessary (either to the ontology or
the knowledge-acquisition tool).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the heart of a successful Protégé-2000 project is the design of the
class and slot structure of the ontology. In
particular, the model you use in building your ontology must balance the needs of the
domain expert when building a knowledge base (at knowledge-acquisition time) against the
requirements of your problem-solving method or application (at run-time). Hopefully, these
are not too contradictory! Ontology developers should therefore both: 

<ul>
  <li>Model the domain with a set of problems and a problem-solving method in mind.</li>
  <li>Design the ontology so that it can be used to generate and customize an appropriate
    KA-tool for a specific set of users.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a simple example from the <a href="newspaper_example.html">Newspaper Example</a>, a
problem to be solved could be finding all advertisements that are more expensive than some
threshold. For this problem, one should build into the ontology a class for advertisements
that includes price and date published. If this information were spread out over all
publication issues, then it would be more difficult for the problem-solver to access all
instances of advertisements and their prices.</p>
