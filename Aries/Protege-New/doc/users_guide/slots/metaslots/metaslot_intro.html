<p>Metaslots, or slot metaclasses, are similar to <a href="../../classes/metaclasses/metaclass_intro.html">metaclasses</a>,
except that they determine the properties of slots instead of classes. A slot
metaclass is a metaclass that can be used as a template to determine the way
Protégé constructs a slot. By creating a new metaslot, you can create a different template
for selected slots. This allows
you to attach additional information to your slot at the class level. This is
especially useful if you have several slots, each of which has a similar
structure.</p>

<p>If you have multiple metaslots in your project, Protégé allows you to
choose which metaslot you want to use as the default for every new slot you
create. This feature is not available for classes in Protégé-2000, since it is
more useful for slots.</p>

<p><font size="3">Metaslots are part of the :SLOT hierarchy in the Class Tab, which is
included in every project. Every
subclass of a metaslot is also a metaslot.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>Note that metaslots appear at the Class Tab. This is because every slot is an
<i>instance</i> of a slot meta<i>class</i>. Slots are <i>not</i> values or
subslots of a global slot.</p>

<h2>STANDARD-SLOT</h2>

<p>By default, when a slot is created as part of a project, Protégé&nbsp; treats that
slot as an instance of the slot metaclass :STANDARD-SLOT. The properties of
:STANDARD-SLOT create the initial view of the slot and determine the properties
in the Slot Form. Just as with :STANDARD-CLASS, you can look at :STANDARD-SLOT to see how the slots
for a metaslot translate to properties of a slot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a new project,&nbsp; :STANDARD-SLOT has a Default <img border="0" src="images/Default.gif" width="11" height="16">
icon to indicate that it is the default metaslot used for creating new slots. If
you create a new metaslot and change the default, the new default will have the <img border="0" src="images/Default.gif" width="11" height="16">
icon.</p>

<h3> Slots for :STANDARD-SLOT</h3>

<p>Just as with :STANDARD-CLASS, the slots for :STANDARD-SLOT translate into
fields in the <a href="../slot_form.html"> Slot Form</a>, as well as other associated properties of the slot.
Various slots of :STANDARD-SLOT create the entry fields and any default values
for Value Type, Cardinality, Maximum and Minimum, etc. The correspondence
between slots for a metaclass and fields in the Class Form is explained in more
detail in <a href="../../classes/metaclasses/metaclass_intro.html">Understanding Metaclasses</a>.</p>

<p>Because of the power of metaclasses, you may want to be particularly cautious
how much you experiment with a current project. It is a good idea to work on a
copy.</p>
