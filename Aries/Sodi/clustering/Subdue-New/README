Subdue 5 README

Installation

  In the 'src' directory, type 'make' and then 'make install'.
  This will put everything in the 'bin' directory.  You can
  type 'make clean' in the 'src' directory to remove the object
  files and executables there.

Documentation

  View docs/manual.html in your favorite browser for details.
  There are several sample input graphs in the 'graphs' directory.

Change History:

Version 5.0.6 (to be released)
- changed design of graph matcher to accept a threshold and discard
  partial matches exceeding the threshold
- removed redundant checks for inserting unique substructures into
  lists of substructures
- removed redundant generation of substructures from instances
- changed "matchCost" field of instances to "minMatchCost"
- removed unused "mapping" field of instances

Version 5.0.5 (1/1/03)
- major changes to graphmatch.c to implement a heap for the mapping queue
- changes to dot.c and calling functions so that graph2dot can handle
  input graphs with positive and negative examples
- fixed error in SubListInsert() so that all eqi-valued substructures
  already on the list are compared to the new substructure to be inserted
- added check in main.c for no substructures returned from DiscoverSubs()
- changed stopping condition in main.c to no edges left instead of only
  single vertex left, and removed check that negative graph compressed
- added timings in seconds per iteration and total
- added output level 5 for printing all substructures considered
- when printing instances, also prints example number containing instance
- final best substructures are numbered in output
- bug fix in DeletedEdges of graphmatch.c to correctly handle self edges
- changed directory structure: bin, docs, src
- added Subdue logo to manual.html
- added ability to read "quoted" labels containing whitespace and the
  comment character (%)

Version 5.04 (10/05/02)
- Improved efficiency of FindInstances, and therefore also finding
  predefined substructures and the sgiso program
- Subdue has a new option '-out' that allows writing the best
  substructures of each iteration in a machine-readable format
- Added the ability to create dot format graphs (see manual.html)
  - Program 'subs2dot' works with the '-out' file of Subdue
    - This gives the ability to view cluster hierarchies
  - Program 'graph2dot' converts a Subdue-formatted graph to dot format
  - Programs 'mdl' and 'sgiso' now have -dot options
- Minor bug fixes
- Updates to this README file and the manual.html file

Version 5.03 (9/26/02)
- Added concept learning capability

Version 5.02 (9/17/02)
- Initial release
