<p>Metaclasses are part of the way Protégé internally handles and constructs classes.. Although you might not use
metaclasses directly in your project, Protégé&nbsp; uses its default metaclasses to
build your classes and determine their properties.&nbsp; By creating your own
metaclasses and defining their slots, you can create additional templates for
your classes. This allows you to give your classes more complex properties and
to greatly extend the power of your Protégé&nbsp; projects.</p>

<p><font size="3">Metaclasses are part of the SYSTEM-CLASS hierarchy, which is
included in every project. Metaclasses appear under the CLASS class. Every
subclass of a metaclass is also a metaclass. All metaclasses appear with the green metaclass
icon in the Class Relationship Pane.</font></p>

<h2>Looking at STANDARD-CLASS</h2>

<p>By default, when a class is created as part of a project, Protégé&nbsp; treats that
class as an instance of the metaclass STANDARD-CLASS. The properties of
STANDARD-CLASS create the initial view of the class and determine the properties
in the Class Form. You can look at STANDARD-CLASS to see how the slots
for a metaclass translate to properties of a class.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> Slots for STANDARD-CLASS</h3>

<p>&nbsp;The slots for STANDARD-CLASS are shown in the Template Slots pane when
you select the class. STANDARD-CLASS uses the standard slot types (String,
Symbol, etc.) that are used for all classes, but does so in a fairly
sophisticated way. The :NAME and :DOCUMENTATION slots are standard String slots
and are not too interesting from the metaclass viewpoint. The other slots are
more complex.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="images/metacl2.gif" width="626" height="253"></p>

<p>For example, consider the :DIRECT-SUPERCLASSES slot. This slot keeps track of
the direct superclasses of a class by storing them as a list of instances.
Internal programmatic operations add and delete instances to from the
appropriate slot value whenever you make changes to a Protégé&nbsp; project. In this
way, Protégé&nbsp; represents the structure of your project using its tools for
storing and representing structure, in much the same way you create the project
structure.</p>

<p>Now look at the :SLOT-CONSTRAINTS slot. This slot allows you to specify the
constraints for a slot as instances of the :CONSTRAINT class. You can create
extending constraints by first creating a subclass of :CONSTRAINT, and using it
to construct new constraints. Here, you may need to use the programmer's API to
correctly specify the constraints. Then, you can create a metaclass that uses
the new constraints. (Is this true???)</p>

<p>Once you have created a metaclass, you can create all or some of the classes
in your project using the new metaclass as a template instead of
:STANDARD-CLASS. Clearly, creating a metaclass of :STANDARD-CLASS and then
creating new slots or overriding existing ones vastly extends the capabilities
of your project.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> STANDARD-CLASS in the Forms Tab</h3>

<p>The Template Slots of any metaclass can be viewed at the Forms Tab. In fact,
internal to Protégé , the Class Form consists of widgets
for :STANDARD-CLASS, and it could be modified using the Forms Tab.&nbsp;Look at
the Forms Tab for :STANDARD-CLASS below and see how it reflects the template
slots listed above. Note that the browser key is automatically set to :NAME.</p>

<h3>Class Form for a Class Created from STANDARD-CLASS</h3>

<p>Since any new class is by default created using :STANDARD-CLASS, the Class
Form itself reflects the structure and layout specified for :STANDARD-CLASS at
the Forms Tab. If you create a new project, go in and modify the Class Form at
the Forms Tab, your modifications will show up for every class, whether existing
or new.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the power of metaclasses, you may want to be particularly cautious
how much you experiment with a current project. It is a good idea to work on a
copy.</p>
