<p>There are two ways to create a new Protégé-2000 project:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#StartProtege">when you start Protégé</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="#ProjectWindow">from within the Protégé window</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="StartProtege"></a>Creating a Project When You Start Protégé</h2>

<p>To create a project when you start Protégé:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start Protégé.&nbsp;<br>
    A dialog box allows you to create a new project, open a recent project, or
    get help.<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/StartDialog.gif" width="541" height="247"></li>
  <li>Unless you have a need for a special format for your files, make sure <b>Standard
    Text Files</b> is selected in the New Project field at the left of the
    window. This will create a project file in Protégé-2000 format. (See <a href="#ProjectStructure">Project
    Structure</a>, below, for more information about file formats.)
  <li>Click <b>New</b>.&nbsp;<br>
    The Protégé window opens and the standard tabs become visible. An initialized knowledge base will be created which contains the system classes rooted in
    :THING. No instances will be created. You can now structure your project by
    creating your classes and slots. (See <a href="../classes/creating_a_class.html">Creating a New Class</a>
    and <a href="../slots/creating_a_slot.html">Creating a Slot</a> for more information.)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To save the project to disk, select <strong>Save</strong>
from the <strong>Project</strong> menu.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Enter a name for your project in the Project line of the dialog box. This is the
    name of your project (.<b>pprj</b>) file.&nbsp;Protégé also creates
    internal files for its own use. By default, these files are given the same
    name, with a different extension.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="ProjectWindow"></a>Creating a Project From the Protégé Window</h2>

<p>To create a new Protégé-2000 project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>New</strong> from the <strong>Project</strong>
    menu <i>or</i> click the New Project button <img border="0" src="images/NewProject.gif" width="16" height="15">.&nbsp;<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/newprojectbutton.gif" width="198" height="98"></li>
  <li>You will be prompted to save changes to the current file, if any. Click <b>Yes</b>
    to save changes, <b>No</b> if for some reason you do not want to modify the
    file (e.g., if you have been browsing or experimenting).</li>
  <li>Select the format you want for your Protégé-2000 files from the Select
    Format dialog and click <b>OK</b>.<br>
    Unless you have a need to create files in a special format, make sure <b>Standard Text Files</b>
    is selected. (See <a href="#ProjectStructure">Project Structure</a>, below,
    for more information about file formats.)</li>
  <li>An initialized knowledge base will be created which contains the system classes rooted in
    :THING. No instances will be created. You can then structure your project by
    creating your classes and slots. (See <a href="../classes/creating_a_class.html">Creating a New Class</a>
    and <a href="../slots/creating_a_slot.html">Creating a Slot</a> for more information.)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>To save the project to disk, select <strong>Save</strong>
from the <strong>Project</strong> menu.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Enter a name for your project in the Project line of the dialog box. This is the
    name of your project (.<b>pprj</b>) file.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="ProjectStructure"></a>  Project Structure</h2>

<p>Each time you create a project, you are given a choice of project formats.
Unless you have a need for a specific structure (e.g., for exporting files), you
should select Standard Text Files. No matter which format you choose, the information specific to the Protégé-2000 interface is saved in a <b>pprj</b> (<b>P</b>rotégé <b>pr</b>o<b>j</b>ect)
file. You can create, open, and save your projects directly via the <b>pprj</b>
file. You do not need to name or access any other files unless you wish to <a href="building_a_project.html">import</a>
a project.</p>

<p>Internally, Protégé maintains two files in addition to the <b>pprj</b>
 file; these files contain further information
about the ontology and instances of the project. When you open a <b>pprj</b>
file, Protégé-2000 automatically loads these files. By default, the additional files are saved in text format:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a text file containing the class and slot information, given the extension <b>pont</b>
    (<b>P</b>rotégé <b>ont</b>ology).</li>
  <li>a text file containing the instance information, given the extension <b>pins</b>
    (<b>P</b>rotégé <b>ins</b>tances).</li>
</ul>

<p>Whenever you are creating a project, you are given a choice of formats in
which these files could be saved:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Standard Text Files</b> (the default) creates the project files in Protégé-2000
    format as described above. These can also be viewed with any text editor or word processor.</li>
  <li><b>JDBC Database</b> creates the project as a table in a JDBC database. To
    do this you must have a database installed and configured on your system.
    See <a href="saving_a_database_project.html">Saving a Database Project</a>
    for more information.</li>
  <li><b>Resource Description Framework (RDF)</b> saves the project in RDF format.
    See <a href="saving_RDF_project.html">Saving an RDF Project</a> as well as <a href="../rdf_support.html"> RDF Support in Protégé-2000</a>
    for more information.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If your version of Protégé-2000 has been customized to support additional
    formats, then you will also see them in this list.</p>

<p>In all cases, Protégé-2000 still uses the <b>pprj</b>  file to access the
project.&nbsp;You should not see a difference within Protégé.</p>
