Class of an Instance <br>
<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>You can change the class of an instance using drag-and-drop in the
<a href="instances_tab.html"><font size="3">Instances Tab</font></a>.
To change the class of an instance:
<ol>
  <li>Select the class that contains the instance in the <a href="class_pane_at_instances.html">Class
    Pane at the Instances Tab</a>.</li>
  <li>Select the instance you want to move in the <font size="3"><a href="instances_pane.html">Direct
    Instances pane</a>.</font></li>
  <li>Hold down the mouse button and drag the instance from the <font size="3"><a href="instances_pane.html">Direct
    Instances pane</a></font> to the <a href="class_pane_at_instances.html">Class
    Pane at the Instances Tab</a> until it is on top of the desired class.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Release the mouse. The instance will now have the selected class as its
    direct type. Note that the slots of the dragged instance will automatically change to reflect the
inheritance from the new class.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Note:</b> When you drag an instance to a new class, the fields in the
instance will change to match the slots in the class. If you drag an instance,
you may lose some of the information in your instance. This loss is permanent.
You <i>cannot</i> restore the information by dragging the instance back to the
original class. In addition, any changes you make will be evident wherever that
instance is referenced -- for example, if that instance appears as the value of a
field, the change will also occur in the field. Therefore, you should be sure
you want to make these changes before you drag an instance to a new class. You
can use the backreferences <img border="0" src="../images/BackReferences.gif" width="13" height="13">
button to see where this instance is referenced before changing its class. You
may also wish to save a backup of the project before you move instances. See <a href="../projects/renaming_a_project.html">Renaming
a Project</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p>
