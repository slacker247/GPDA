Configuring OiLEd.
==================

OilEd can be configured to use alternative rendering and parsing
classes. This is specified in the config.xml file which is
loaded in at startup time. Appropriate menu items will then be added
to the tool. 

For example, if you never want to use the GML renderer and would
rather have that removed, or don't intend to use earlier DAML+OIL
schema, these could be removed (or commented out) of the configuration
file.

In addition, simple "plugins" can be added.

Parsing
-------

Parsers should implement the interface

uk.ac.man.cs.img.oil.parser.Parser

Parsers are specified within the <parsers> section. Each entry is of
the form: 

<parser class="CLASS" extension="EXT" description="DESC"/>

This informs OilEd that class CLASS is an Oil Parser that expects to
find files of type DESC, which it looks for using extension EXT.

Rendering
---------

Renderers for export should implement the interface

uk.ac.man.cs.img.oil.output.Renderer. 

Renderers can be grouped together into collections which will fall
under one menu item on the main menu bar. Each <renderers> section has
a number of renderers, each of which in turn specifies the menuItem
text that it should appear under. The entire <renderers> section also
specifies the overall heading for the menu bar.

Plugins
-------

Plugins should implement the interface

uk.ac.man.cs.img.oil.ui.OntologyPluginPanel.

Plugins are specified within the <plugins> section and each plugins 
entry should specify the implementation class for the plugin. 

Preferences
-----------

Reasoner host/port and web proxy host/port can be set up.
