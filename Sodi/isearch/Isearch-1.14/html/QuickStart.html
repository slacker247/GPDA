<H2>or, Installing and Using Isearch for the Hopelessly Impatient<br>
with Slightly More Thorough Instructions for Those who Care.
</H2>

<h2>Erik Scott, Scott Technologies, Inc.</h2>

<P>
Isearch is a text search system developed by CNIDR.  CNIDR is
the Center for Networked Information Discovery and Retrieval.
 They are part of a non-profit corporation known as MCNC.  MCNC
used to stand for &quot;Microelectronics Center of North Carolina&quot;,
but they dropped the long form and now they're legally just MCNC.
 Anyway, the lawyers thought you'd like to know that.
<P>
Isearch pretty much does one thing:  it lets the user search through
a bunch of text by hunting for words.  It doesn't &quot;understand&quot;
your text collection, it doesn't try to parse it, it just uses
slightly-less-than-brute-force statistical methods to hunt for
words in documents.  It does this by building indexes.  An Isearch
index is a just like the index in a book:  if you look for a word
in the index of a book, it tells you a page number to look at.
 Likewise, if you search for a word with Isearch, it looks in
the index for a filename associated with that word and then shows
that file to you.  It can do more complicated things, but that's
the basic game plan.
<P>
Installing Isearch requires five steps:
<OL>
<LI>Get Isearch.  If you're reading this, there's a good chance
you've already finished this step and the next one.
<LI>Uncompress and un-tar the distribution.  Again, unless someone
printed this and put it on your desk, you're through with this
step, too.
<LI>Edit the Makefile.  This is where you tell Isearch what kind
of machine you have.  If you have a fairly mainstream Unix box,
there won't be any problem.  If you have a strange machine, then
you've probably had a lot of practice porting software by now
anyway.
<LI>Compile.  If you did Step 3 correctly, then this is a no-brainer.
On the other hand, this is rarely a no-brainer in the real world.
<LI>Index and search some sample text so you know you did things
right.
</OL>

<P>
Really, installation usually isn't tricky at all.  Start to finish
should take around thirty minutes the first time, and about ten
when you download new versions.
<H2>STEP 0: GET GCC and GZIP</H2>

<P>
Okay, we lied: There's an extra step.  You really should have
gcc and g++ on your machine, and you must have gzip (and its companion
gunzip) so you can unpack the archive that Isearch comes in. 
You can get gzip and gcc via anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu
in the directory /pub/gnu.  Gzip installation is fairly simple.
 Unpack the tar file and follow the instructions in the file &quot;README&quot;.
 Installing gcc and g++ is a lot more complicated.  In principle,
you could use a vendor-supplied C++ compiler.  The Solaris SparcWorks
C++ compiler is known to work, and the CenterLine C++ compiler
has also compiled Isearch successfully.  The bad news is that
there are several subtly different versions of the C++ specification
and each compiler views it a little differently.  Getting Isearch
to work with a different compiler is about like porting Isearch
to another machine.  Isearch is also fairly dependent on compiler
versions, especially with gcc.  Gcc users should make sure they
are using at least 2.7.X.  Note that the old, pre-compiled gcc
for Solaris is not meant to be a general-purpose compiler: it's
just enough of a compiler to compile a newer version of gcc.
<P>
Incidentally: You're also going to have to install libg++ if you
haven't already.  SAme ftp site, same directory.  Install it after
you install g++.
<H2>STEP 1: GET ISEARCH</H2>

<P>
You should always work from the latest version of Isearch available.
Bugs are being corrected and new features are being added daily
(literally).  You can always get the newest version from ftp.cnidr.org.
 Here's a sample session where we will download today's version
of Isearch from ftp.cnidr.org by logging in as &quot;anonymous&quot;,
sending our email address as our password, changing the current
directory to &quot;/pub/NIDR.tools/Isearch&quot;, making sure
we're in binary mode for ftp, and getting the file:

<P>
Notice a few things:
<OL>
<LI>There are precompiled binary kits for IBM RS6000, Linux on
an Intel box, DEC OSF/1 (now called Digital Unix, soon to be called
&quot;The Operating System Formerly Known as 'Prince'&quot;) for
Alpha (now know as Alpha AXP), Solaris 2.X for Sparc, SunOS 4.1.X
for Sparc, and Ultrix for DEC PMAX architectures (DECstation 3100s,
5000s, and their kin).  If you have one of these machines and
you really can't get Isearch to compile in step 4, consider using
one of these binary kits.  If you don't have one of the above
architectures then you're going to have to build from source code
anyway.
<LI>There is a directory named &quot;untested&quot;.  The files
in that directory are, well, untested.  If you need an absolutely
newest and greatest version, then look in here.
</OL>

<H2>STEP 2: UNCOMPRESS AND UN-TAR THE DISTRIBUTION</H2>

<P>
You should now have a copy of Isearch as a gzipped tar tar.  The
&quot;.gz&quot; suffix indicates a gzipped file, and the &quot;.tar&quot;
suffix indicates it's tarred.  The first thing to do is to uncompress
the file:
<P>
<TT>sti-gw% gunzip Isearch-1.13.tar.gz</TT>
<P>
You now have a (much larger) file called &quot;Isearch-1.13.tar&quot;.
<P>
The next step is to un-tar the file we just uncompressed.  In
our example, we're going to want to install Isearch so it has
the path name &quot;/local/project/Isearch-1.13&quot;.  To do
this, copy or move the file to &quot;/local/project&quot;:
<P>
<TT>sti-gw% mv Isearch-1.13 /local/project</TT>
<P>
Finally, we'll un-tar the distribution:
<P>
<TT>sti-gw$ cd /local/project</TT>
<P>
<TT>sti-gw% tar xf Isearch-1.13.tar</TT>
<P>
There should now be a directory named /local/project/Isearch-1.13,
and it should contain the Isearch distribution:
<PRE>
sti-gw% ls /local/project/Isearch-1.13
CHANGES    Makefile   TUTORIAL   doctype
COPYRIGHT  README     bin        src
</PRE>

<P>
If you see all of that, then you probably got it right.
<H2>STEP 3: EDIT THE MAKEFILE</H2>

<P>
This is the part that makes people nervous, but it really isn't
that bad at all.  You need to edit the Makefile with your favorite
editor, and essentially just follow the instructions.  Edit /local/project/Isearch-1.13/Makefile
in this example (you won't have to edit the makefiles in the subdirectories,
they automatically inherit what they need).
<P>
The first choice is for compiler.  Probably 99% of the world should
leave the default &quot;g++&quot;.  Isearch is developed by people
who use g++, so that's your best bet.  It's also hard to beat
the price.  
<P>
The second choice is for &quot;CFLAGS&quot;, which are the options
to pass to the compiler.  There are canned selections for you
to choose from.  If you don't know what to select, then &quot;CFLAGS=-g
-DUNIX -Wall&quot; is a good starting guess.
<P>
The third choice is for the location to install the finished programs.
The default &quot;/usr/local/bin&quot; is a good guess.  Note
that if you don't elect to actually &quot;make install&quot; in
step 4 then you'll never have to set this.
<P>
The rest of the choices probably should be left alone.
<P>
While on the subject of editing files, it's worth noting that
the file /local/project/Isearch-1.13/doctype/dtconf.inf describe
how many &quot;doctypes&quot; your copy of Isearch will be aware
of.  A doctype is essentially a file type handler; there are doctypes
for simple ASCII files, files of separate paragraphs, and so forth.
 You can almost always just leave this file alone and take the
default, which is &quot;Give me all of 'em!&quot;.
<H2>STEP 4: COMPILE</H2>

<P>
At this point, you should be able to 
<PRE>
sti-gw% cd /local/project/Isearch-1.13
sti-gw% make
</PRE>

<P>
And all the right things will happen.  Note that many compilers
will print a few warning lines along the way, but they're warning
about pretty harmless stuff.  If there are any errors, then the
compilation will grind to a halt.  Otherwise, when you're done
there will be new files in the &quot;bin&quot; subdirectory:
<PRE>
sti-gw% ls bin
Iindex        Isearch       Iutil         libIsearch.a
</PRE>

<P>
If you got that far, then you can (optionally) :
<PRE>
sti-gw% make install
</PRE>

<P>
and the compiled executables will be copied to /usr/local/bin.
<H2>STEP 5: INDEX SOME TEXT AND SEE HOW IT WORKS</H2>

<P>
Now let's index a little text and see if Isearch really works.
 First, let's pick a couple of files to index.  In this example,
we'll index the files &quot;CHANGES&quot; and &quot;COPYRIGHT&quot;
since we know everyone has them.
<PRE>
sti-gw% cd /local/project/Isearch-1.13
sti-gw% mkdir testIndex
sti-gw% cd testIndex
sti-gw% /local/project/Isearch-1.13/bin/Iindex -d tester ../CHANGES ../COPYRIGHT
Iindex 1.13
Building document list ...
Building database tester:
   Parsing files ...
   Parsing /local/project/Isearch-1.13/CHANGES ...
   Parsing /local/project/Isearch-1.13/COPYRIGHT ...
   Indexing 1870 words ...
   Merging index ...
Database files saved to disk.
sti-gw% ls
tester.dbi  tester.inx  tester.mdg  tester.mdk  tester.mdt
</PRE>

<P>
That created five index files to describe the two files we indexed.
Don't worry, we could have indexed every file on your system and
still only had five index files.  Now let's do a little searching
and see how well we did:
<PRE>
sti-gw% /local/project/Isearch-1.13/bin/Isearch -d tester RSET table
../bin/Isearch -d tester RSET table
Isearch 1.13
Searching database tester:
1 document(s) matched your query, 1 document(s) displayed.
      Score   File
   1.   100   /local/project/Isearch-1.13/CHANGES
Select file #: 
</PRE>

<P>
At this point, if you enter &quot;1&quot; and press return, it
will display the contents of &quot;CHANGES&quot;.  If you press
return without a number, Isearch will exit.  This is sort of a
trivial example, but if you index thousands of files then the
above search will list the ones that contain either &quot;RSET&quot;
or &quot;table&quot;.  If you run Isearch without any arguments
then it will give a list of all of its options, what they mean,
and some examples of their use.  For more information, see the
Isearch Tutorial included with the distribution.
