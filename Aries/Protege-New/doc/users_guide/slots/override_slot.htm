You can override slot properties by editing the slot at the class level <i>only</i>.
This creates overrides
    that appear at the selected class and its subclasses. The slot remains unchanged at
    the <font size="3"><a href="slots_tab.html">Slots Tab</a>, any
superclasses,
    and any unrelated classes. A slot with overrides is shown with an <img border="0" src="../classes/images/OverriddenSlot.gif" width="11" height="16">
    override icon in the </font><a href="../classes/template_slot_pane.html">Template Slots pane</a>.
<p>Overriding a slot at the class level allows you to be more restrictive about
the slot facets relative to that class. For example, the slot <b>employee_list</b>
is a slot of type Instance that takes the value <b>Employee</b> at the top
level. By default, whenever you attach this slot to a class, it will range over
the instances of <b>Employee</b>. Suppose, however, that for this class, you
want to restrict the possible employees to salespeople. By overriding the slot,
you can restrict the value range to the <b>Salesperson</b> subclass of <b>Employee</b>
for the current class and its subclasses, without affecting the slot value range
for any other class.</p>
<p>Similarly, suppose you had a class of articles which appeared only on work
days, not Saturday or Sunday. You override the slot <b>weekday</b> at that class
to remove Saturday and Sunday from the Symbol list for that class only,
restricting the possibilities to working days. Once again, the top-level slot
and its range at other classes will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>When you override a slot at a class, you can edit slot facets in the same way
as you can at the top level. However, you <i>cannot</i> change the name of a
slot with overrides. It must still inherit the name of the top-level slot.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Currently, when you override a slot, Protégé does not enforce
the restrictive property. That is, you could theoretically expand or change the
facets of a slot, rather than restricting them. However, it is <i>not</i>
recommended that you do this, both because it is not good practice and because
Protégé may enforce restriction in the future.</p>

<p> To edit the slot properties for a specific class:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select a class in the <a href="../classes/class_relationship_pane.html">Class
    Relationship pane</a> in the <a href="../classes/classes_tab.html">Classes tab</a>.</li>
  <li>Select the slot you wish to edit in the <a href="../classes/template_slot_pane.html">Template Slots pane</a>.</li>
  <li>Click the <font size="3">View Slot at Class </font><img border="0" src="../classes/images/ViewSlotAtClass.gif" width="15" height="15"> 
    <a href="../classes/template_slot_buttons.html">Slot
    button</a> at the upper right of the <a href="../classes/template_slot_pane.html">Template Slots pane</a><i>
    or </i>double-click the slot and make sure View slot at class is selected in
    the Select Slot View dialog box, then click OK. This opens the <a href="slot_form.html">Slot Form</a>
    for the selected slot. See <a href="editing_slot_properties.html">Editing Slot Properties</a>
    for more information.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>A slot that has been edited at a class is shown with an override <img border="0" src="../classes/images/OverriddenSlot.gif" width="11" height="16">
icon in the <a href="../classes/template_slot_pane.html">Template Slots pane</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also edit the properties of a slot directly, instead of
just overriding them at a class. See <a href="edit_top_level.htm">Editing a Top-Level Slot</a>
for more information.</p>
