Metaclass of Subclasses<br>
<img src="../images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p><b>Note: </b>Before you create and use metaclasses, you should be confident
with the basic Protégé interface and be comfortable designing a project, and
creating and modifying classes, slots, forms and instances.</p>

<p>When you change the metaclass of a class, all of its subclasses will retain
their previous metaclass. This ensures that you do not propagate changes when
you do not want to. However, often you will want existing subclasses to have the
same metaclass as their parents. Protégé provides an option to quickly change
the metaclasses of all the classes subordinate to a given class. Note that you
only have to do this once; by default, new classes use the metaclass of their
direct superclass.</p>

<p>You can only change the metaclasses to match the metaclass of the selected
class. If the selected class has :STANDARD-CLASS as its metaclass, all
subclasses will lose any additional metaclass information.</p>

<p>To do work with metaclasses, you must have added one or more metaclasses to your project, either by
creating them directly, or by including a project that already has metaclasses. This example uses the wines project, which includes a Wine template that
supplies metaclass structure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="3">To change the metaclass of all existing subclasses of a given
class:</font></p>

<ol>
  <li><font size="3">In the <a href="../class_relationship_pane.html">Class Relationship Pane</a>,
    find the class whose sublcasses you want to change.&nbsp;<br>
    <img border="0" src="images/change11.gif" width="284" height="331"></font></li>
  <li><font size="3">Click the right mouse button and select &quot;Change
    metaclass of subclasses.&quot;&nbsp;<br>
    </font><img border="0" src="images/sub_change2.gif" width="259" height="184"></li>
  <li>A dialog box pops up for verification. Click OK to continue.<br>
    &nbsp;<img border="0" src="images/change10.gif" width="439" height="99"></li>
  <li>The change is made and all subordinate classes now have the metaclass of
    the selected class.</li>
</ol>
