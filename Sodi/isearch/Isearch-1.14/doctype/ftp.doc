The FTP doctype

Format:
The FTP doctype expects files in the following format:

This first line up to a \n character describe the file for searching.
The rest of the document, this line included, can be anything, even
a gziped tar file.

The format is intended to make a free text searchable ftp site.

How it works:

Indexing and multiple document handling is inherited from doctype:
i.e., this is just like any plain vanilla text file.  The present
is where the first line vs. everything else decision is made.  A "B"
present shows things up to the first newline character (the first line,
in other words).  An "F" present shows everything after the first newline.

Personally, if I were going to make a searchable FTP archive, I wouldn't
use this doctype.  I'd use the gopher or filename  doctypes.  As a 
no-extra-cost benefit, it would also be gopher-accessable.  Plus I 
wouldn't have to edit the files by hand.  You loose the ability to
search on the maintainer-provided description (unless you use the filename
doctype with really hairy filenames, which isn't a bad idea) but the
maintenance becomes so much simpler.
