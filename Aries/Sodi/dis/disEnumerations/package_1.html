<body>

An extensive class library providing predefined enumeration values,
which are the special constants used to fill DIS protocol data unit (PDU) fields. 

These classes have been automatically generated from the on-line DIS Data Dictionary. 

You may also want to refer to the local copy of the DIS Data Dictionary to see what the
DIS Specification has to say about enumeration values for PDU fields.
