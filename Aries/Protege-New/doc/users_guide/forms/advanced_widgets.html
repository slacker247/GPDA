<p align="left">In addition to the included widget types, you can add the
capacity for more complex widgets to your Protégé-2000 project by loading
special projects that extend the possible widgets. Protégé-2000 includes the
following projects, in the <b>newspaper</b> folder, that allow you to extend the
types of widget you can use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">a <b>table</b> project, which allows you to display
    information stored as a function of two classes in tabular format</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">a <b>diagram</b> project, which allows you to display
    relational information in the form of a diagram or graph.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">To use these widgets, you must not only include the related
project, but you must add other information to your project and, in the case of
tables, make sure your project is actually constructed to support the widget.
The additional work required, however, allows you to create an interface which
conveys complex information in a visual and immediate way.&nbsp;See the <a href="../../tutorial/index.html">tutorial</a>
for more information.</p>
