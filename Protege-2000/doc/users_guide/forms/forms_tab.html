<p>The Forms tab provides a single window in which you may view and edit
prototype <b>forms</b>.
The forms you design and create at the Forms tab can be viewed in their final
format at the <a href="../instances/instances_tab.html">Instances tab</a>. End
users will use the finished forms to enter instances into
the knowledge base.&nbsp;</p>

<p> The Forms tab window consists of two panes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <a href="forms_pane.html"> Forms pane</a> at the left shows the hierarchy of all the classes and
    allows you to clear all customizations from your form as well as to create a
    form with one of the following preset layouts: the default layout, the
    layout of a form that has been created for a parent, or the layout of a form
    for another class.</li>
  <li>The <a href="form_edit_pane.html"> Form Edit pane</a> shows the layout of the form associated to the selected
    class. Each slot in the class is associated with a user-interface widget on
    the form. If you have not created or modified the form, Protégé-2000 uses
    a default layout based on the slot type and cardinality.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>As mentioned above, the forms you design will appear at the <a href="../instances/instances_tab.html">Instances
