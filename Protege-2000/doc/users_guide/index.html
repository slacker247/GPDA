<h1><img src="images/nerd.gif" WIDTH="48" HEIGHT="48"> What is Protégé-2000?<br>
<img src="images/header_line.gif" width="590" height="6"></h1>

<p>Protégé-2000 is an integrated software tool used by system developers and domain
experts to develop <a href="glossary.html#Knowledge-based system" target="_self"><font color="#008080"><em>knowledge-based
systems</em></font>.</a> Applications developed with Protégé-2000 are used in
problem-solving and decision-making in a particular <a href="glossary.html#Domain" target="_self"><font color="#008080"><em>domain</em></font></a>.</p>

<p>While our earlier Protégé/Win, like a classical database system, separately defined <em>classes</em>
of information (schema) and stored <em>instances</em> of these classes, Protégé-2000
makes it easier to work simultaneously with both classes and instances. Thus, a singular
instance can be used on the level of a class definition, and a class can be stored as an
instance. Similarly, <em>slots,</em> which earlier were employed only within classes, are
now elevated to the same level as classes. With this new knowledge model we also
facilitate conformance to the <a href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~okbc/" target="_self"><em>Open Knowledge
Base Connectivity (OKBC)</em></a> protocol for accessing knowledge bases stored in
knowledge representation systems. Finally, <em>applications</em> on top of these
components are also executed within the integrated Protégé-2000 environment.</p>

<p>The Protégé-2000 tool accesses all of these parts through a uniform GUI (graphical
user interface) whose top-level consists of overlapping tabs for compact presentation of
the parts and for convenient co-editing between them. This &quot;tabbed&quot; top-level
design permits an integration of&nbsp; (1) the modeling of an <a href="glossary.html#Ontology" target="_self"><font color="#008080"><em>ontology</em></font></a> of
classes describing a particular subject, (2) the creation of a <em><a href="glossary.html#Knowledge-acquisiton tool" target="_self"><font color="#008080">knowledge-acquisition
tool</font></a> </em>for collecting knowledge, (3) the entering of specific instances of
data and creation of a <a href="glossary.html#Knowledge base" target="_self"><font color="#008080"><em>knowledge
base</em></font></a>, and (4) the execution of applications. The ontology defines the set
of concepts and their relationships. The knowledge-acquisition tool is designed to be
domain-specific, allowing domain experts to easily and naturally enter their knowledge of
the area. The resulting knowledge base can then be used with a <a href="glossary.html#Problem-solving method (PSM)" target="_self"><font color="#008080"><em>problem-solving
method</em></font></a> to answer questions and solve problems regarding the domain.
Finally, an <a href="../../applet_demo/EligibilityWriter/eligWriter.html" target="_self"><em><strong>application</strong></em></a>
is the end product created when the knowledge base is used in solving an end-user problem
employing appropriate problem-solving, expert-system, or decision-support methods.</p>

<p>The main assumption of Protégé-2000 is that knowledge-based systems are usually very
expensive to build and maintain. For example, the expectation is that knowledge-based
system development is a team effort, including both developers and domain experts who may
have less familiarity with computer software. Protégé-2000 is designed to guide
developers and domain experts through the process of system development. Protégé-2000 is
designed to allow developers to reuse domain ontologies and problem-solving methods,
thereby shortening the time needed for development and program maintenance. Several
applications can use the same domain ontology to solve different problems, and the same
problem-solving method can be used with different ontologies. For more information about
building knowledge-based systems and the Protégé-2000 approach, see <a href="planning_a_project.html" target="_self">Planning a Protégé-2000 Project</a>.</p>

<p>Protégé-2000 is currently being used in clinical medicine and the biomedical
sciences, although it can be used in any field where the concepts can be modeled as a
class hierarchy. Throughout this online guide, you will see examples of a newspaper domain
used to illustrate points of explanation; for more information about this running example,
see an overview of the <a href="newspaper_example.html" target="_self">Newspaper Example</a>.</p>
