What is Jambalaya?
------------------

Jambalaya is the keyword we use to describe a project to integrate
SHriMP with the Protege tool.  You can view Protege projects directly
inside of SHriMP, or alternatively, use SHriMP as an additional view
(tab) within Protege.  The latter is preferred, and the former is
only included to demonstrate that we can integrate other
components within SHriMP. 


Installation instructions
-------------------------

Please refer to the file SETUP.TXT included alongside this document.


Where can I find more documentation for Jambalaya?
