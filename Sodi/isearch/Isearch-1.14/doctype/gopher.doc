The GOPHER doctype

Format:
The GOPHER doctype expects to find text files.  The doctype can then
handle presents in one of two ways.  An "F" present is always handled by
dumping the entire content of the file, but the "B" filename is ever
so slightly subtle.

If the text file is named /local/path/textfile, then the "B" present
method will try to open a file named /local/path/.cap/textfile.  If this
open is successful, the contents of the capfile will be used to form
the headline.  If the open is unsuccessful, then the headline will
be "textfile", which is the name of the file.

When compiling, if you #define FULLFILENAME then the headline will
consist of a fully-qualified filename.  Otherwise the headline will
consist only of the basename.  I don't know which way you'd rather have
it, so you decide.
