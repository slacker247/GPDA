What is a Diagram</font></b> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most user interaction 
  with the Protege GUI is done via forms. Each class has a form associated to 
  it, and each instance is simply a filled out form. For example, the <a href="editor_in_ontology.gif">Editor</a> 
  class has an <a href="editor_in_forms_layout.gif">associated form</a>, and instances 
  of Editor are displayed as <a href="acquiring_an_editor.gif">filled-out forms</a>. 
  This approach facilitates structured data entry for instances. More generally,&nbsp; 
  it simplifies local interaction with the knowledge base (e.g., looking at and 
  editing small number of instances in great detail). Often, however, users want 
  to be able to view a large number of instances at once, along with selected 
  relationships among the instances. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Diagrams are one 
  way to accomplish this latter goal. A diagram is, visually, a set of nodes and 
  connectors (also known as &quot;links&quot; or &quot;wires&quot;) that join 
  the nodes. Underlying these are instances of classes. Nodes map to domain objects 
  and connectors map to instances of Connector-- a class the diagram widget uses 
  to represent important relationships. When the user sees a diagram, they see 
  a high-level summary of a large number of instances, without seeing a lot of 
  the details of any particular instance. For example, in <a href="step9.gif">this 
  diagram </a>(which we'll discuss in detail later), 8 nodes, which are instances 
  of 3 distinct classes (represented by distinct shapes and colors), are displayed. 
  In addition, 7 connectors, visually representing the &quot;supervises&quot; 
  relationship are displayed. While the user cannot, for example, immediately 
  determine the social security number of Mr. Science, she does immediately see 
  Mr. Science's place in the organization chart (and, if she is a domain expert, 
  can probably immediately intuit his roles and responsibilities within the organization).

  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Walking Through an 
  Example</font></b> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">To make this more 
  concrete, we're going to walk through an example, adding the ability to use 
  the diagram widget to an existing project. In this case, we will be adapting 
  the newspaper project. </font><br>
  &nbsp;
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Step 1:&nbsp; 
  Load the existing project and decide what you will represent using diagrams</font></b> 
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We will use <a href="step1.gif">the 
  newspaper project</a>. We will use the diagram widget to visually represent 
  the chain of command in the newsroom (e.g., we will create an organization chart). 
  </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 2: Make 
  sure the diagram project is included</b> </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The next step is 
  to make sure that the project being modified includes the diagrams project (the 
  diagrams&nbsp; project contains a few key concept definitions the diagram widget 
  requires). The diagram project is included in your Protege-2000 distribution, 
  as part of the examples directory. To see if the diagrams project is already 
  included, you can use the <i>Project</i> menu and choose the <a href="step2.gif"><i>Show 
  Included Project</i>s</a> option. If the diagram project is not included,&nbsp; 
  you can include it by using the <i>Include... </i>option on the <i>Project</i> 
  menu. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 3: Find 
  the class you want to use in conjunction with the diagram widget</b> </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Our goal is to 
  represent the managerial hierarchy (who reports to whom)&nbsp; visually&nbsp; 
  in an organization chart. The newspaper project already contains a class, <i><a href="step3.gif">Organization</a></i>, 
  which contains this information. So we will start by modifying <i>Organization</i>, 
  to bring it in line with what the diagram widget requires. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 4: Make 
  the diagram class from step 3 a subclass of <i>Network</i> and change its metaclass 
  to <i>Network_Metaclass</i></b> </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We need to alter 
  <i>Organization</i> in two ways: we need to make it a subclass of <i>Network</i> 
  and we need to change its metaclass to <i>Network_Metaclass</i>. Both <i>Network</i> 
  and <i>Network_Metaclass</i> are defined in the diagrams project we included 
  as part of step 2.&nbsp; </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> Making <i>Organization</i> 
  a subclass of <i>Network</i> causes 5 template slots to be attached to <i>Organization</i>. 
  These slots will be used by the diagram widget to record information about the 
  visual representation of the diagram (e.g., object locations and connectivity 
  relationships).&nbsp; </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Changing the metaclass 
  of <i>Organization</i> to <i>Network_Metaclass</i> attaches the slot <i>node_slot</i> 
  to <i>Organization</i> as an own slot -- that is, <i>node_slot</i> appears on 
  the Class Form for <i>Organization</i>. We will use <i>node_slot </i>to tell 
  the diagram widget a little bit more about the structure of our intended diagram. 
  (You can change the metaclass of an existing class by clicking the right mouse 
  button to access the Class Menu. See <a href="../../users_guide/classes/metaclasses/change_meta.html">Changing 
  the Metaclass of a Class</a> for more information.) </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">At the end of this 
  step, <i>Organization</i> looks like <a href="step4.gif">this</a>. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 5: Choose 
  the nodes slot</b> </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Once we've finished 
  altering the definition of <i>Organization</i>, we still need to set a value 
  for <i>node_slo</i>t. The motivation for using <i>node_slot</i> is this: knowledge-bases 
  should be structured, as much as possible, in ways that make sense to domain 
  experts, based on their experience in the domain. In particular, choosing to 
  use a diagram widget shouldn't alter the knowledge-base structure (in step 4, 
  this precept is violated. But only a little bit, and only by adding slots to 
  classes). </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This rule leads 
  to a problem: the diagram widget needs to know where to store the instances 
  corresponding to the nodes in the diagram. Since the instances corresponding 
  to nodes are often instances of important domain concepts, there is usually 
  already a slot that points to them (unlike Connectors. The <i>connectors </i>slot 
  attached to <i>Organization</i> probably isn't redundant with an existing slot). 
  In our example, Organization already has a slot called <i>employees</i>, which 
  points to all the employees in the Organization. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">What we need to 
  do is find a way to tell the diagram widget &quot;store the instances corresponding 
  to the nodes in the diagram in <i>this slot</i>.&quot; We do this by storing 
  a slot reference in&nbsp; <i>node_slot</i> does-- the diagram widget stores 
  all the instances corresponding to nodes in a slot, which is the value of&nbsp; 
  <i>node_slot.</i> </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The value of <i>node_slot</i> 
  must meet three criteria: it must be attached to must be attached to <i>Organization</i> 
  as a template slot it must be multiple-valued, and it must be of type Instance. 
  The value of<i> node_slot</i> is the slot is used by the diagram widget to store 
  the instances which are displayed in the diagram as nodes. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In our example, 
  <a href="step5.gif">we use the <i>employees</i> slot as the value of <i>node_slot</i></a>. 
  </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 6: Create 
  connectors</b> </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Connectors are 
  classes whose instances store information about a link in a diagram. A definition 
  of a connector&nbsp; records two distinct types of information: which types 
  of objects can be connected by this link and which (if any) slots on the objects 
  to fill out. In our example, there is a single type of connector, <i><a href="step6.gif">Supervises</a></i>. 
  As with all connectors, Supervises is a subclass of <i>Connector</i> and an 
  instance of <i>Connector_Metaclass</i>. An instance of <i>Supervisor</i> can 
  connect an instance of <i>Editor</i> to an instance of <i>Employee</i>. And, 
  when it does so, the <i>supervises</i> slot on the instance of <i>Editor</i> 
  will point to the instance of <i>Employee</i>. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Defining the connectors 
  is the last step which involves modifying the ontology. The remaining steps 
  all involve either configuring the diagram widget or acquiring instances. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 7:&nbsp; 
  Choose which slots to display and select the diagram widget:</b> </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first step 
  in configuring the diagram class&nbsp; is probably to hide the slots it inherited 
  from <i>Network</i>. These slots are automatically filled out by the diagram 
  widget and contain information that, while important to the structure of the 
  knowledge-base, are slots the user probably won't want to see. <br>
  In our example, we hide all of the inherited slots: <i>connectors</i>,<i> last_divider_location</i>, 
  <i>main_panel_height</i>, <i>main_panel_width</i>, and <i>layout_information</i>. 
  </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After doing this, 
  <a href="step7.gif">we must still choose to use the diagram widget for the <i>employees</i> 
  slot</a>. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 8: Configure 
  the diagram widget</b> </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Double-clicking 
  on the diagrams widget brings up a panel with an extensive number of configuration 
  options. These options allow the diagram widget to display different types of 
  information (e.g., different node classes) in different ways. In <a href="step8.gif">our 
  example</a>, our node types (<i>Editor</i>, <i>Columnist</i>, <i>Reporter</i>, 
  and <i>Salesperson</i>) all have distinct visual representations. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 9: Acquire 
  instances</b> </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, after 
  all this hard work, knowledge-acquisition can actually take place. <a href="step9.gif">Here</a> 
  is a screenshot of the diagram widget in action. </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Step 10: Send 
  feedback to the Protege group</b> </font>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The diagram widget 
  is one of the more complex, and cumbersome, widgets that ships with Protege.
