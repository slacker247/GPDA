@section What is ODBC and where does it come from ?

@strong{ODBC} (@code{@strong{Open Database Connectivity}}) provides a way for client programs to 
access a wide range of databases or data sources.

ODBC is a standardized API, developed according to the specifications of
the SQL Access Group, that allows one to connect to SQL databases. It 
defines a set of function calls, error codes and data types that can be
used to develop database independent applications.

ODBC is usually used when database Independence or simultaneous access 
to different data sources is required.

For more information about ODBC, refer to @uref{http://www.microsoft.com/data/odbc/}.

@node Reporting Problems, Feature Request, MyODBC Support, General Information
@section How do I report the problems or bugs with MyODBC (3.51) ?


If you encounter difficulties with @code{MyODBC} or @code{MyODBC 3.51},
you should start by making a log file from the @code{ODBC Manager}
(the log you get when requesting logs from @code{ODBC ADMIN}) and a
@code{MyODBC} or @code{MyODBC 3.51} log.

@strong{To get an ODBC trace through Driver Manager, you need to do the following:}

@itemize @tab
@strong{To open ODBC Data Source Administrator:}
@*@*

@itemize
@item
Click @code{@strong{Start}}, point to @code{@strong{Settings}}, and then click @code{@strong{Control Panel}}.
@item
On computers running @code{@strong{Microsoft Windows 2000}}, double-click @code{@strong{Administrative Tools}},
and then double-click @code{@strong{Data Sources (ODBC)}} as shown below:

@* @image{Images/mydsn-icon} @*@*

On computers running an earlier version of @code{@strong{Microsoft Windows}},
double-click @code{@strong{32-bit ODBC}} or @code{@strong{ODBC}}. @*

@strong{The @code{@strong{ODBC Data Source Administrator}} dialog box appears, as shown below:}@*

@* @image{Images/mydsn} @*@*

Click Help for detailed information about each tab of the @code{@strong{ODBC Data 
Source Administrator}} dialog box.@*
@end itemize

@*
@strong{To enable the trace option, you need to do the following:}
@*
@*

@itemize @bullet
@item
The @code{@strong{Tracing}} tab of the @code{@strong{ODBC Data Source Administrator}}
dialog box enables you to configure the way ODBC function calls are
traced.
@item
When you activate tracing from the @code{@strong{Tracing}} tab, the
@code{@strong{Driver Manager}} will log all ODBC function calls for all
subsequently run applications.
@item
ODBC function calls from applications running before tracing is
activated are not logged. ODBC function calls are recorded in a
log file you specify.
@item
Tracing ceases only after you click Stop Tracing Now. Remember that
while tracing is on, the log file continues to increase in size and
that this affects the performance of all your ODBC applications.

@* @image{Images/mydsn-trace} @*@*
@end itemize

@strong{To enable the trace option on Unix, you need to do the following:}@*@*
@itemize
@strong{On Unix}, you need to explicitly set the @code{@file{TRACE}} option in the
@code{@file{ODBC.INI}}.

Set the tracing @code{ON} or @code{OFF} by using @file{TRACE} and @file{TRACEFILE} 
parameters in @file{odbc.ini} as shown below:

@example
  TraceFile  = /tmp/odbc.trace
  Trace      = 1
@end example

Where @file{TRACEFILE} specifies the name and full path of the trace file and 
@file{TRACE} is set to ON or OFF. You can also use 1 or YES for ON and 0 or NO 
for OFF.@*@*

@strong{Note}, if you are using @file{ODBCConfig} from @code{unixODBC}, then 
follow the instructions from '@uref{http://www.unixodbc.org/config.html, 
HOWTO-ODBCConfig}', to trace the unixODBC calls.
@end itemize


@*
@strong{To get @code{MyODBC} or @code{MyODBC 3.51} driver log, you need to do
the following:}
@*
@*
@itemize @bullet

@item
Ensure that you are using @file{myodbc3d.dll} and not
@file{myodbc3.dll} for @code{MyODBC 3.51}
(and @file{myodbcd.dll} for @code{MyODBC}).

The easiest way to do this is to get @file{myodbc3d.dll}
(or @file{myodbcd.dll}) from the @code{MyODBC 3.51} distribution and
copy it over the @file{myodbc3.dll} (or @file{myodbc.dll}),
which is probably in your @file{C:\windows\system32} or
@file{C:\winnt\system32} directory. Note that you probably want to
restore the old @file{myodbc.dll} file when you have finished testing,
as this is a lot faster than @file{myodbc3d.dll} (or @file{myodbcd.dll}),
so do keep a backup copy of original DLLs.

@item
Tag the @code{@strong{`Trace MyODBC'}} option flag in the MyODBC connect/configure
screen. The log will be written to file @file{C:\myodbc.log}.
If the trace option is not remembered when you are going back to the
above screen, it means that you are not using the @file{myodbcd.dll}
driver (see above). On Linux or if you are using DSN-Less connection,
then you need to supply @code{OPTION=4} in the connection string.

@item
Start your application and try to get it to fail.
Check the MyODBC trace file, to find out what could be wrong.

If you find out something is wrong, please send a mail to
@email{myodbc@@lists.mysql.com} (or to @email{support@@mysql.com},
only if you have a support contract from MySQL AB) with a brief
description of the problem, with the following additional information:@*

@itemize @minus
@item MyODBC version
@item ODBC Driver Manager type used and its version
@item MySQL server version
@item ODBC trace from Driver Manager
@item MyODBC log file from MyODBC driver
@item Simple reproducible sample

@end itemize
@end itemize
@*
Remember that the more information you can supply to us,
the more likely it is that we can fix the problem! Also,
read the MyODBC mailing list archive from
@uref{http://lists.mysql.com/}, before posting the bug.

@section How do I install the driver from binary distributions ?


To install @code{MySQL ODBC Drivers} on @code{Windows}, you should download the 
appropriate distribution file for your operating system from
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-myodbc.html}, unpack it, and execute
the SETUP.EXE file. 

On Windows/NT you may get the following error when trying to install
@code{MyODBC 2.50}:

@example
An error occurred while copying C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MFC30.DLL. Restart
Windows and try installing again (before running any applications which
use ODBC)
@end example
The problem in this case is that some other program is using ODBC and
because of how Windows is designed, you may not in this case be able to
install a new ODBC drivers with Microsoft's ODBC setup program. In most
cases you can continue by just pressing @code{Ignore} to copy the rest
of the MyODBC files and the final installation should still work.  If
this doesn't work, the solution is to re-boot your computer in ``safe
mode`` (Choose this by pressing F8 just before your machine starts
Windows during re-booting), install @strong{MyODBC}, and re-boot to normal
mode.

On @strong{Linux}, Download the RPM package and follow the instructions.

@subsubheading Requirements:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{MDAC}, Microsoft Data Access SDK from @uref{www.microsoft.com/data/}
@item
@strong{MySQL client libraries and include files} from 3.23.14 and above.
This is required because MyODBC uses new calls that only exist 
starting from the above library, @uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/index.html}
@end itemize

@subsubheading Building MyODBC 3.51:
@code{MyODBC 3.51} distributes its sources with @strong{Makefiles} that uses
@file{nmake}. In the distribution, one can find @file{WIN_Makefile} for building the
release version and @file{WIN_Makefile_debug} for building the Debug version of
driver libraries and DLLs. To build the driver:

@itemize @bullet
@item
First, download and extract the sources to a folder @file{myodbc3-src},
and follow the commands to build and install the release version   

@example
 Command> cd myodbc3-src
 Command> nmake -f Win_Makefile
 Command> nmake -f Win_Makefile install
@end example

@file{nmake -f Win_Makefile} builds the release version of the driver and places
the binaries in sub directory called @file{release}. @file{nmake -f Win_Makefile install} 
installs (copies) the driver DLLs and libraries(@file{myodbc3.dll} and @file{myodbc3.lib}
) to your system directory.@* 

@*
@item
Similarly you can build the debug version by making use of the Makefile 
@file{Win_Makefile_Debug} as shown below:

@example
 Command> nmake -f Win_Makefile_debug
 Command> nmake -f Win_Makefile_debug install
@end example

@item
You can clean and rebuild the driver by using:
@example
 Command> nmake -f Win_Makefile clean
 Command> nmake -f Win_Makefile install
@end example

@strong{Note}, make sure to specify the correct MySQL client libraries and header
files path in the Makefiles(MYSQL_LIB_PATH and MYSQL_INCLUDE_PATH). It assumes the 
default path as @file{C:\mysql\include} and @file{C:\mysql\lib\opt} for release DLLs 
and @file{C:\mysql\lib\debug} for debug versions. Also, for the usage of @file{nmake}, 
please refer to the following online link, 
@uref{http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wcepb40/htm/_wcepb_nmake_tool.asp, NMake Tool}

@end itemize
@strong{Testing the Driver Libraries:}@*
After the driver libraries are copied/installed to the system directory, you can test whether 
the libraries you built are properly built are not by using the samples provided 
in the @file{samples} sub-directory:

@example
 Command> cd samples
 Command> nmake -f Win_Makefile all
@end example


@subsubheading Building MyODBC 2.50:
@code{MyODBC} distributes its sources as VC Project for windows. One can
build the driver using the direct VC project files (.dsp and .dsw) provided
in the distribution.  



@node Unix source, Development source, Windows source, Installation Related
@section How do I install the driver from sources on Unix ?

@subsubheading Requirements:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@strong{MySQL client libraries} and include files from 3.23.14 and above. 
This is required because MyODBC uses new calls that only exist 
starting from the above library, @uref{http://www.mysql.com/downloads/index.html}
@item
The MySQL library must be configured with '--with-thread-safe-client'
libmysqlclient installed as a shared library.
@item
One of the following unix ODBC driver managers:@*
  - @strong{iodbc} 3.0 or later, (http://www.iodbc.org), installed @*
  - @strong{unixodbc} Alpha 3 or later (http://www.unixodbc.org), installed  
@item
If you using a @strong{character set} that isn't compiled into the MySQL
client library (the defaults are:latin1 big5 czech euc_kr gb2312 gbk sjis tis620 
ujis) then you need to install the mysql character definitions from the charsets 
directory into SHAREDIR (default @file{/usr/local/mysql/share/mysql/charsets});
These should already be into place if you have installed the MySQL server on 
the same machine.
@end itemize

Once you have all the required files, unpack the source files to a
separate directory and follow the instructions as given below:

@subsubheading Configuration:

The only required options are
    @code{--with-mysql-libs=DIR}
    @code{--with-mysql-includes=DIR}
Where @code{DIR} is the directory where the mysql libraries and
include files are.

If using @code{iodbc}, if @code{iodbc} is not installed in its default
location (@file{/usr/local}),
you might have to use
    @code{--with-iodbc=DIR} or
If the iODBC headers are not residing in @file{DIR/include},
you can also use
    @code{--with-iodbc-includes=INCDIR}
Same goes for libraries; if they are not in @file{DIR/lib},
use
    @code{--with-iodbc-libs=LIBDIR}

If using @code{unixODBC}, to make @file{configure} look for
@code{unixODBC} instead of @code{iODBC}, use
    @code{--with-unixODBC=DIR}
Where @code{DIR} is where unixODBC is installed.

And (as usual), if the unixODBC headers and libraries aren't located in
@file{DIR/include} and @file{DIR/lib}, use
    @code{--with-unixODBC-libs=LIBDIR}
    @code{--with-unixODBC-includes=INCDIR}

You might want to specify a prefix other than @file{/usr/local}
for installation, for example keep MyODBC drivers in
@file{/usr/local/odbc/lib}, so you can specify
    @code{--prefix=/usr/local/odbc}

Final Configuration example looks like this:

@example
  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local 
                --with-iodbc=/usr/local
                --with-mysql-libs=/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql
                --with-mysql-includes=/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql 
@end example


@subsubheading Building the driver libraries:

To build the driver libraries, you have to just execute @file{make},
which takes care of everything.

@example
  $ make
@end example

Should build the libraries. If any errors occurs, correct them and continue 
the build process. If you can't able build, then send a detailed email to 
@email{myodbc@@lists.mysql.com} for further assistance.

@subsubheading Installing driver libraries:
@example
  $ make install
@end example

Installs the following set of libraries:
@example
  - libmyodbc3.so, 
  - libmyodbc3-3.51.01.so, where 3.51.01 is the version of the driver
  - libmyodbc3.a for @strong{MyODBC 3.51} or
  
  - libmyodbc.so
  - libmyodbc-2.50.39.so, where 2.50.39 is the version of the driver
  - libmyodbc.a for @strong{MyODBC 2.50}
@end example

For more information on build process, refer to the @file{INSTALL} file
that comes with the source distribution.

@code{@strong{Note}}, If you are trying to use the @file{make} from @code{SUN}, 
then you will end up with errors. On the other hand, @file{Make} from @code{GNU}
should work fine on all platforms.


@strong{Mac OS X Notes:}
If you want to build the driver on Mac OS(Darwin), then make use of the following 
configure example:

@example
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local 
              --with-unixodbc=/usr/local
              --with-mysql-libs=/usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql
              --with-mysql-includes=/usr/local/mysql/include/mysql
              --disable-shared
              --enable-gui=no
              --host=powerpc-apple

@section How do I install the driver from development source tree ?


@strong{Caution:} You should read this section only if you are interested
in helping us test our new code.

To obtain our most recent development source tree, use these instructions:

@enumerate
@item
Download @strong{BitKeeper} from
@uref{http://www.bitmover.com/cgi-bin/download.cgi}.  You will need
@strong{Bitkeeper} 2.0 or newer to access our repository.
@item
Follow the instructions to install it.
@item
After @strong{BitKeeper} is installed, first go to the directory you
want to work from, and then use this command if you want to clone
the MyODBC 3.51 branch:

@example
shell> bk clone bk://work.mysql.com:7003 myodbc-3.51
@end example
In the above example the source tree will be set up in the
@file{myodbc-3.51/} or by default @file{myodbc3/} sub directory of
your current directory.
The initial download of the source tree may take a while, depending on the
speed of your connection; be patient.
@item
You will need GNU @code{autoconf 2.13}, @code{automake 1.4},
@code{libtool}, and @code{m4} to run the next set of commands.

@example
shell> cd myodbc-3.51
shell> bk -r edit
shell> aclocal; autoheader; autoconf;  automake;
shell> ./configure  # Add your favorite options here
shell> make
@end example
For more information on how to build, refer to @file{INSTALL} file located 
in the same directory.  On Windows, make use of Windows
Makefiles @file{WIN-Makefile} and @file{WIN-Makefile_debug} in
building the driver, for more information, see
@ref{Windows source}.
@item
When the build is done, run @code{make install}, to install the
@code{MyODBC 3.51} driver on your system.
@item
If you have gotten to the @code{make} stage and the distribution does
not compile, please report it to @email{myodbc@@lists.mysql.com}.
@item
After the initial @code{bk clone} operation to get the source tree, you
should run @code{bk pull} periodically to get the updates.
@item
You can examine the change history for the tree with all the diffs by using
@code{bk sccstool}.  If you see some funny diffs or code that you have a
question about, do not hesitate to send e-mail to
@email{myodbc@@lists.mysql.com}.@*
Also, if you think you have a better idea on how to do something, send an 
e-mail to the same address with a patch. @code{bk diffs} will produce a 
patch for you after you have made changes to the source. If you do not 
have the time to code your idea, just send a description.
@item
@strong{BitKeeper} has a nice help utility that you can access via
@code{bk helptool}.

@section What is a Data Source Name ?


A data source identifies a path to data that can include a network
library, server, database, and other attributes-in this case; the
data source is the path to @code{MySQL} database. To connect to a
data source, the Driver Manager checks the Windows registry for
specific connection information. 

The @code{ODBC Driver Manager} and @code{MyODBC Drivers} use the
registry entry created by the @code{ODBC Data Source Administrator}.
This entry contains information about each data source and its
associated driver. Before you can connect to a data source, its
connection information must be added to the registry.


@node DSN Types, DSN on Windows, Data Source Name, Connection Related
@section What is the difference between Machine and File Data Sources ?

@code{@strong{Machine data sources}} store connection information in the Windows Registry 
on a specific computer with a user-defined name. You can use machine data 
sources only on the computer they are defined on. There are two types of 
machine data sources:
@itemize @bullet
 @item @code{User data source}, and 
 @item @code{System data source}. 
@end itemize

@code{@strong{User data sources}} can be used only by the current user and are visible only 
to that user. @code{@strong{System data sources}} can be used by all users on a computer and 
are visible to all users on the computer and system-wide services, such as 
Microsoft Windows NT services. 

A machine data source is especially useful when you want to provide added security, 
because only users who are logged on can view a machine data source and it cannot 
be copied by a remote user to another computer.

@code{@strong{File data sources}} (also called @code{DSN files}) store connection information in a 
text file, not the Windows Registry, and are generally more flexible to use than 
machine data sources. For example you can copy a file data source to any computer 
with the correct ODBC driver so that your application can rely on consistent and 
accurate connection information to all the computers it uses. Or you can place the 
file data source on a single server, share it between many computers on the 
network, and easily maintain the connection information in one location.

A @code{file data source} can also be unshareable. An unshareable file data source 
resides on a single computer and points to a machine data source. You can use 
unshareable file data sources to access existing machine data sources from file 
data sources.

@node Connection parameters, Without DSN, DSN on Unix, Connection Related
@section What are all the different MyODBC (3.51) connection parameters ?


One can specify the following parameters for @strong{MyODBC} or
@strong{MyODBC 3.51} on the @code{[Data Source Name]} section of an
@code{ODBC.INI} file or through the @code{InConnectionString}
argument in the @code{SQLDriverConnect()} call.

@multitable @columnfractions .2 .2 .6
@item @strong{Parameter} @tab @strong{Default value} @tab @strong{Comment}
@item user @tab ODBC (on Windows) @tab The username used to connect to MySQL.
@item server @tab localhost @tab The hostname of the MySQL server.
@item database @tab @tab The default database
@item option @tab 0 @tab A integer by which you can specify how @strong{MyODBC 3.51} should work. See below.
@item port @tab 3306 @tab The TCP/IP port to use if @code{server} is not @code{localhost}.
@item stmt @tab @tab A statement that will be executed when connection to @code{MySQL}.
@item password @tab @tab The password for the @code{server} @code{user} combination.
@item socket @tab @tab The socket or Windows pipe to connect to.
@end multitable

The @code{OPTION} argument is used to tell @strong{MyODBC 3.51} that the
client isn't 100% ODBC compliant. On Windows, one normally sets the
option flag by toggling the different options on the connection screen
but one can also set this using @code{OPTION} connection argumentin. 
The following options are listed in the same order as they appear in 
the @strong{MyODBC 3.51} connect screen:

@multitable @columnfractions .1 .9
@item @strong{Bit} @tab @strong{Description}
@item 1 @tab The client can't handle that @strong{MyODBC} returns the real width of a column.
@item 2 @tab  The client can't handle that MySQL returns the true value of affected rows.  If this flag is set then MySQL returns 'found rows' instead.  One must have MySQL 3.21.14 or newer to get this to work.
@item 4 @tab Make a debug log in c:\myodbc.log.  This is the same as putting @code{MYSQL_DEBUG=d:t:O,c::\myodbc.log} in @file{AUTOEXEC.BAT}
@item 8  @tab Don't set any packet limit for results and parameters.
@item 16 @tab Don't prompt for questions even if driver would like to prompt
@item 32 @tab Enable or disable the dynamic cursor support. This is not allowed in MyODBC 2.50.
@item 64 @tab Ignore use of database name in 'database.table.column'.
@item 128 @tab Force use of ODBC manager cursors (experimental).
@item 256 @tab Disable the use of extended fetch (experimental).
@item 512 @tab Pad CHAR fields to full column length.
@item 1024 @tab SQLDescribeCol() will return fully qualified column names
@item 2048 @tab Use the compressed server/client protocol
@item 4096 @tab Tell server to ignore space after function name and before @code{'('} (needed by Power Builder).  This will make all function names keywords!
@item 8192 @tab Connect with named pipes to a @code{mysqld} server running on NT.
@item 16384 @tab Change LONGLONG columns to INT columns (some applications can't handle LONGLONG).
@item 32768 @tab Return 'user' as Table_qualifier and Table_owner from SQLTables (experimental)
@item 65536 @tab Read parameters from the @code{client} and @code{odbc} groups from @file{my.cnf}
@item 131072 @tab Add some extra safety checks (should not bee needed but...)
@end multitable

If you want to have many options, you should add the above flags.  For
example setting option to 12 (4+8) gives you debugging without package
limits.

The default @file{MYODBC3.DLL} is compiled for optimal performance.  If
you want to to debug @strong{MyODBC 3.51} (for example to enable tracing),
you should instead use @code{MYODBCD3.DLL}.  To install this file, copy
@file{MYODBCD3.DLL} over the installed @code{MYODBC3.DLL} file.

@section Can I connect without a predefined DSN ?


Yes.  One can connect to the MySQL server using SQLDriverConnect, by
specifying the @code{DRIVER} name field.

For example here is the connection strings for @strong{MyODBC} and

@strong{@code{AT SYSTEM "B"}:}

@itemize @bullet

@item
Start the MySQL server.
@item
GRANT proper privileges to user @file{myuser} using the following command,
so that the user can connect from @file{system A} using password
@file{mypassword}.

@example

you should be either root or another user with appropriate privileges. For
more information about MySQL privileges, refer to 
@uref{http://www.mysql.com/doc/U/s/User_Account_Management.html, 
MySQL User Account Management}.
@end itemize

@strong{@code{AT SYSTEM "A"}:}

@itemize @bullet
@item
Configure MyODBC or MyODBC 3.51 DSN, with the following connection
parameters:

@example
   DSN            = remote_test
   SERVER or HOST = B (or IP address of System B)
   DATABASE       = test (The default database or appropriate one)
   USER           = myuser
   PASSWORD       = mypassword   
@end example
   For DSN-less connection, refer to @ref{Without DSN}.
@item
Check whether you are able to access @file{system B} from @file{system A} by 
using ping or other means. If you are not able to reach system B, check for
your network or Internet connections or contact your system administrator.
@item
Now, try to connect using @strong{@code{"DSN=remote_test"}}. If it fails, trace the

@section The structure or location of a linked table has been changed. Can I see those changes locally in linked tables ?


Yes. Use the following procedure to view or to refresh links when the
structure or location of a linked table has changed. The Linked Table Manager
lists the paths to all currently linked tables. 

@strong{To view or refresh links:}

@enumerate

@item
Open the database that contains links to tables.
@item
On the @code{Tools} menu, point to @code{Add-ins}, and then click @code{Linked Table Manager}.
@item
Select the check box for the tables whose links you want to refresh.
@item
Click OK to refresh the links.

@end enumerate

Microsoft Access confirms a successful refresh or, if the table wasn't found, displays
the @code{Select New Location of} <table name> dialog box in which you can specify it’s the
table's new location.If several selected tables have moved to the new location that
you specify, the Linked Table Manager searches that location for all selected tables,
and updates all links in one step. 

@strong{To change the path for a set of linked tables:}

@enumerate

@item
Open the database that contains links to tables.
@item
On the @code{Tools} menu, point to @code{Add-ins}, and then click @code{Linked Table Manager}.
@item
Select the @code{Always Prompt For A New Location} check box.
@item
Select the check box for the tables whose links you want to change, and then click @code{OK}.
@item
In the @code{Select New Location of} <table name> dialog box, specify the new location, click

@node DELETED problem, Write conflict, Linked Tables, MS Access Related
@section When I insert or update a record in linked tables, I get @code{#Deleted#}.  How do I overcome from this ?


If the inserted or updated records are shown as @code{#DELETED#} in the access, then:

@itemize @bullet
@item
If you are using Access 2000, you should get and install the newest (version 2.6 or
above) Microsoft MDAC (Microsoft Data Access Components) from
@uref{http://www.microsoft.com/data/, here}.
This will fix the following bug in Access: when you export data to MySQL, the table
and column names aren't specified. Another way to around this bug is to upgrade to
MyODBC Version 2.50.33 and MySQL Version 3.23.x, which together provide a workaround
for this bug! You should also get and apply the Microsoft Jet 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5),
which can be found @uref{http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx ?scid=kb;EN-US;q239114, here}.
This will fix some cases where columns are marked as @code{#DELETED#} in Access. Note
that if you are using MySQL Version 3.22, you must to apply the MDAC patch and use
MyODBC 2.50.32 or 2.50.34 and above to go around this problem.
@item
For all Access versions, you should enable the MyODBC option flag @code{Return matching
rows}. For Access 2.0, you should additionally enable @code{Simulate ODBC 1.0}.
@item
You should have a timestamp in all tables you want to be able to update. For maximum
portability TIMESTAMP(14) or simple TIMESTAMP is recommended instead of other
TIMESTAMP(X) variations.
@item
You should have a primary key in the table. If not, new or updated rows may show up as
#DELETED#.
@item
Only use DOUBLE float fields. Access fails when comparing with single floats. The symptom
usually is that new or updated rows may show up as #DELETED# or that you can't find or
update rows.
@item
If you are linking a table through MyODBC, which has BIGINT as one of the column, then
the results will be displayed as #DELETED#. The work around solution is:
@itemize @bullet
@item Have one more dummy column with TIMESTAMP as the data type, preferably TIMESTAMP(14).
@item Check the 'Change BIGINT columns to INT' in connection options dialog in ODBC DSN Administrator
@item Delete the table link from access and re-create it.
@end itemize
@item
It still displays the previous records as #DELETED#, but newly added or updated records will
be displayed properly.

This is a strange issue from Access 97, and doesn't appear with Access 2000 or 2002. 
You can overcome from this by upgrading MyODBC driver to MyODBC 3.51.02 and above.


@node Modified error, Trapping ODBC Errors, Access97 Export, MS Access Related
@section Access  returns error like @code{"Another user has modified the record that you have modified"}, while editing the records. How can I overcome from this ?

In most cases this can be solved by doing one of the following things:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Add a primary key for the table if there isn't one already.
@item
Add a timestamp column if there isn't one already.
@item
Only use double float fields. Some programs may fail when they compare single floats.
@end itemize
If the above doesn't help, you should do a @code{MyODBC} trace file and try to figure out why things go wrong.

@node COUNT(*) with MyODBC , AppendChunk() and GetChunk(), VB Related, VB Related
@section While executing the query @code{"SELECT count (*) FROM table .."} using MyODBC (3.51), it returns an error. What is the reason ?


It's because the @code{'COUNT(*)'} expression is returning a BIGINT, 
and ADO can't make sense of a number this big. Set the option to treat 
BIGINTs as INTs in MyODBC (option value 16384). 



@node AppendChunk() and GetChunk(), Total number of rows, COUNT(*) with MyODBC , VB Related
@section Whenever I use AppendChunk() or GetChunk() methods of ADO, I get an error '@code{Multiple-step operation generated errors. Check each status value}'. What is the reason ?


The @code{'GetChunk()'} and @code{'AppendChunk()'} methods from ADO doesn't work as 
expected when the cursor location is specified as adUseServer. On the other 
hand, by using adUseClient, one can overcome from this error.

@section How do I retrieve Data from MySQL to MS-WORD/Excel Documents ?


To retrieve data from MySQL to Word/Excel documents, you need to
use the @code{MyODBC} driver and the Add-in Microsoft Query help.

For example, create a db with a table containing 2 columns of text:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Insert rows using the @code{mysql} client command-line tool.
@item
Create a DSN file using the MyODBC driver, for example, my for the db above.
@item
Open the Word application.
@item
Create a blank new documentation.
@item
Using the tool bar called Database, press the button insert database.
@item
Press the button Get Data.
@item
At the right hand of the screen Get Data, press the button Ms Query.
@item
In the Ms Query create a New Data Source using the DSN file my.
@item
Select the new query.
@item
Select the columns that you want.
@item
Make a filter if you want.
@item
Make a Sort if you want.
@item
Select Return Data to Microsoft Word.
@item
Click Finish.
@item
Click Insert data and select the records.

Yes. MyODBC 3.51 supports @code{@strong{Dynamic cursor}} type along with 
@code{@strong{Forward-only}} and @code{@strong{static}}. 

Due to the performance issues, the driver does not support this feature by 
default. One can enable this, by specifying the connection option flag as 
@code{@strong{OPTION=32}} or by checking the @code{@strong{'Enable Dynamic 
Cursor'}} option from the DSN configuration.

@strong{Caution}: Using ODBC.NET with MyODBC, while fetching empty string
