<font face="Arial" size="2"><li>I downloaded Snort log file: </li></font><a href="http://project.honeynet.org/scans/scan20/0108@000-snort.log.tar.gz"><font face="Arial" size="2">0108@000-snort.log.tar.gz</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2"> and verified checksum:<br>

<br>
<li>I extracted the Snort log file 0108@000-snort.log using:<br>

</li><br>
<li>I reviewed the trace file to determine what the sequence of events of the attack were.</li><br>

<p><b><font face="Arial">Answers</font></b></p>
<ol>

<font face="Arial" size="2"><li>What is a NOP slide, and how is this one different from the NOP slide in the rpc.statd exploit in </li></font><a href="http://project.honeynet.org/scans/scan10/scan10.txt"><font face="Arial" size="2">Scan10</font></a><font face="Arial" size="2">? <br>
<br> A NOP slide is a technique used in buffer overflow exploit code to pad
the buffer when the exact end of the buffer is not known or it is not obvious
where code execution might begin. Then if the exploit can set the instruction
pointer to point to any memory location within the NOP instruction padding,
the CPU will "slide" into the executable code.<br>
<br> The rpc.statd exploit in Scan 10 was for a Linux OS on an x86 system.
For the x86 architecture, the NOP code is 1 byte with the value 0x90. The
dtspcd attack was on a Solaris Sparc system, and the NOP code for the Sparc
architecture is 4 bytes long with the value 0x801c4011.<br>
<br>
<li>The attack was on 08 Jan, 2002. Would Snort have generated an alert then for the attack? <br>
<br> It depends. The version of Snort available on 1/8/02 was 1.8.3. The
default set of rules that came with 1.8.3 did include a signature for detecting
an attempt to execute shellcode on a Sparc system that could have detected
this attack. It wouldn’t have specifically identified the attack as the dtspcd
exploit, though. However, the shellcode rules file was commented out in the
default snort.conf file, so unless it was uncommented, Snort would not have
detected the attack at all.<br>
</li><br>
<li>In the exploit code, the command "/bin/sh sh -i" is given, what is its purpose, and why is 'sh' shown twice? <br>
<br> At this point in the attack the attacker is creating an inetd configuration
file in /tmp/x to create a root command shell whenever a client connects
to port 1524 on the compromised system. From the inetd.conf man page, the
syntax for an inetd configuration file entry is:<br>
<br>
</li></font><font face="Courier New" size="2">service-name endpoint-type protocol wait-status uid server-program server-arguments<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">where</font><font face="Courier New" size="2"><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">server-program is the pathname of the server program to be invoked by inetd, and<br>
server-arguments is defined as the entire command line (including argument 0).</font><font face="Courier New" size="2"><br>
<br>
</font><font face="Arial" size="2">In this case, "/bin/sh" was the server-program and "sh -i" were the server arguments, where "sh" is argument 0.<br>
<br>
<li>The attacker executed a variety of commands on the hacked Solaris box.
Which commands were automated by the exploit, which commands were manual
by the attacker himself? <br>
<br> Based on the times at which the commands were executed and the way that
many were combined on a single line, I’d speculate the breakdown is as follows:<br>
<br>
<u>Exploit</u><br>
<table cellpadding="2">
<tbody><tr><td valign="top"><font face="Courier New" size="2">09:46:07</font></td><td><font face="Courier New" size="2">Exploit

<tr><td valign="top"><font face="Courier New" size="2">09:47:38</font></td><td><font face="Courier New" size="2">mv sun1 /bin/login</font></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<br>
</li><br>
<li>What is sun1, and how does it work? <br>
<br>
&gt;From the trace file, it appears that sun1 is a trojan replacement for /bin/login.<br>
<br>
Excerpts from the trace:<br>
<br>
</li></font><font face="Courier New" size="2">mv /bin/login /usr/lib/libfl.k<br>
chmod 555 sun1<br>
mv sun1 /bin/login</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
<br> I did not actually execute it on a Sun system though, so I can’t say
definitively how it works. If I were to hazard a guess, I’d say that it has
a hardcoded password in it that if supplied gives a root shell. If the password
is not supplied, it probably then calls the original login program from /usr/lib/libfl.k.
This guess is based partially on looking at other login trojans, and running
strings against sun1.<br>
<br>
<li>What did you learn from this exercise? <br>
<br> I learned quite a bit more about the details of buffer overflows than
I knew before. While I always knew the basic concepts behind these exploits,
this exercise allowed me the opportunity to research them in more depth.
Of particular help were the following resources:<br>

1 hour for initial investigation<br>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Bonus Question:</b><br>
One of the commands executed during the attack is </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">echo "BD PID(s): "`ps -fed|grep ' -s /tmp/x'|grep -v grep|awk '{print $2}'` </font></p>

<font face="Arial">
</font><font face="Arial" size="2"></font><p><font face="Arial" size="2">The
first thing the attack program did after successfully exploiting the dtspcd
server was create a listening process on port 1524 which would create a root
shell upon a network connection from a remote client. The way it did this
was by creating an inetd configuration file, /tmp/x, with the following entry:<br>
<br>
</font><font face="Courier New" size="2">ingreslock stream tcp nowait root /bin/sh sh –I<br>
</font></p>
<font face="Arial" size="2"><p>It then created the listening process by running inetd with /tmp/x as its input file:</p>

</font><font face="Courier New" size="2"><p>/usr/sbin/inetd –s /tmp/x</p>

</font><font face="Arial" size="2"><p>So, the "echo" command above will display
the PID of the inetd process associated with the root command shell back
door if it was successfully installed. And, hence, my guess is that BD stands
for Back Door.</p></font></body></html>
