Metaclass From an Existing Class<br>

<p>You can turn any existing class in your project into a metaclass. This allows
you to take any class you have developed and use its attributes for classes that
are unrelated in the hierarchy. You can make a class into a metaclass in one of
two ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By adding a metaclass as an additional superclass of the class</li>
  <li>By changing the superclass of the class to a metaclass</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adding a Metaclass as a Superclass</h2>

<p>By adding a metaclass as an additional superclass of an existing class, you

<h2>Replacing a Superclass with a Metaclass</h2>

<p><font size="3">Unless a class already has multiple superclasses, changing its
metaclass will remove it and all of its subclasses from the standard
hierarchy.&nbsp; Its instances will not be visible in the Instance Tab. To
change the superclass of a class to a metaclass:</font></p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the class in the Class Relationship pane.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Drag the class to the desired metaclass. The selected superclass must itself be a metaclass, as indicated by a green
    class icon <img border="0" src="../images/Metaclass.gif" WIDTH="15" HEIGHT="16">.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><font size="3">
 The superclass of the dragged class will change to the selected metaclass. The
    dragged class, and all of its subclasses, will inherit the properties of the selected
    metaclass.</font></li>
</ol>
