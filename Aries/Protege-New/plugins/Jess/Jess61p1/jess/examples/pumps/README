                  Pumps and Tanks Java Beans Example
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple example of matching Java Bean objects on the LHS of Jess
rules. Both Tank and Pump objects can be matched in this way. The
script pumps.clp shows how you might use these classes. This is a
real-time control problem; Jess is perfactly capable of monitoring and
adjusting the tanks and pumps to keep them from exploding. 

There are two ways to run this problem. To run the version in which
all the objects are created from Jess 

        java jess.Main jess/examples/pumps/pumps.clp

from the JessXX/ directory (after compiling these source files; please
read the notes about compiling Java source.) The rules in pumps.clp
use a sort of "damped" control algorithm that does a decent job of
keeping up with the pumps and tanks. There is a crude GUI, too, so you
can watch what's going on.

Besides this script, I'm also supplying an example main() program
which creates a Pump and a Tank from Java, tells Jess about them, and
then batches the rules in "pumps-fromjava.clp". This rulebase includes
a cruder algorithm for controlling the pump; it fails fairly quickly
and the tank will burst. To run this problem this way, type

        java jess.examples.pumps.MainInJava

again, from the JessXX/ directory.
