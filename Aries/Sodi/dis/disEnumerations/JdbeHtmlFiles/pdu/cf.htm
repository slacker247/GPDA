<p><BR><H4>Number of Targets in Track/Jam Field Field</H4>

<B>Size: </B>8<BR>

<B>Data Type: </B>Unsigned<BR>

<B>Description: </B>This field, in conjunction with the following field, provides a mechanism for an emitter to identify targets that are being illuminated by a track beam or target emitters it is attempting to jam. When employed by a tracking emitter, this field shall specify the number of targets that are being identified as being tracked. When employed by a jamming emitter, this field shall specify the number of emitters the system is attempting to jam. This field shall be represented by an 8-bit unsigned integer. When the number of entities being tracked or jammed exceeds a certain threshold then the High Density Track/Jam field shall be used and zero shall be entered in the Number of Targets in Track/Jam field. The threshold may be established at exercise start or during the exercise by meams of Simulation Management PDUs. If no value is established, the default shall be TARGETS_IN_TJ_FIELD_DFLT.<BR>
